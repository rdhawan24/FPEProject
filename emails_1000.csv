Bill:  Thanks for the info.   I also spoke with Jeff about how 
EnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) 
is responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of 
Jeff's ""positions"" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  
Maybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  
Sara

Sara,

Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
things Credit support for his business.  

It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
Treasury's approval.

Bill

Subject: Credit Derivatives

I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

 <<Keoni.zip>> Chris, per your request here are the 480 and 1480 charges
that have been tracked to date for Enron.  Please keep in mind that the
systems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements
process so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not
applied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should
not be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become
effective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the
Settlement process. 

I checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during
September. 
Take care.

What if we replace Section 2 with something like ""This Agreement shall 
continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,""  and 
replace Section 3 with ""Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon 
written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to

Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft.

Looks like you nailed the least cost billing provision pretty good.  Just

P.S. -- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See 
Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for 
another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such 
notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of 
an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me 
know and I will fax it to you.  

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
handling, and I appreciate your patience.

Hey Philip!

What's up? I have mixed feeling about you going to
ND...I', jealous! This year is out for me
unfortunately.  I have some friends that have gone to
games this year...I'll get the skinny on scalping.  It
shouldn't be much of a prop.  However, despite there
records, it's still ND and Tennesse. It will be sold
out.  But you can get tix.  I know this much. You
can't (or it's against school policy to )get tix on
campus. However, there are plenty of scalper on roads
leading to campus.

Sites to see.  Definietly check out the campus.  Make
time to see the lakes, go by the dome etc. It's
awesome. Also, it may be one of the games of the
week...so, look out for espn, nbc and all the rest.
The hype is great when networks other than nbc show.
Lots of small bars...avoid the linebacker, unless you
want to test that you have the endurance you had in
undergrad. College Football Hall of Fame is
there...downtown.  Tailgating is great....like I said
make sure you get to the game early. That way you'll
get the whole experience. Lots of tradition game day,
for example the Band marches from the dome to the
stadium....it's awesome.

I'll give you a call at work..

Later,

Steve

Hello Vince, Stinson,

Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a
very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very
informative.

As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below
a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.
It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was
and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.

If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,
who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest
to Enron.  The plan is this:

1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem
space.

2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of
good problems of:
a) high practical importance
b) high innovation potential
c) serious scope.

3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy
and execution path.

I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so
that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his
doctoral work in this area.

I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of
starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these
research issues!

Talk to you soon.
Best Regards,

Nick

FYI.

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
""We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,"" Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January. "

Subject: Re: Trip to San Diego

My thoughts for the trip:

Friday:

Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
night- we can walk on the beach!

Saturday:

Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a ""lively 
evening street scene"" and live music.

What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
open- if we are interested.

Shanna

Attached below please find the cash flow/tariff increase study we discussed 2 
1/2 weeks ago at the Sunday DPC strategy session.  The study assumes a 
decrease in losses from 40% to 25% and an increase in collection efficiency 
83% to 92% from 2000-01 to 2006-07.  Further, it is assumed that only one 
block of DPC operates until 2006-07.  

Two scenarios based on average realisation are illustrated:

1. A realistic cash flow study and  accompanying tariffs.  Given the above 
assumptions and assuming there is no state subsidy in 2006-07, MSEB should 
have a cash flow deficit of R34 Cr. in 2006-07 when Phase II comes on line 
for sale to MSEB, given a reasonable annual tariff increase.  (See the tariff 
sheet in gray shaded area.)  The annual rate increases would be15% for LT and 
HT agriculture and LT public water works, a 10% increase for domestic, street 
lights and interstate sales, a 4% increase for LT industrial and powerloom, 
and 1% increase for LT commercial and HT industrial, public water works and 
railways.

2. The annual tariff increases needed for MSEB to break even with a 3% 
profit, assuming industrial and commercial classes are held flat, are 
detailed below.  (See the Tariff sheet in red.) 
 
 Domestic          8%
 LT Public Water Works    35.60% 
 LT Agriculture and Poultry   26% 
 Street Light     10.8%
 HT Agricultural & Poultry    26.9%
 Mula Pravara Electric Coop Soc.  24.30% 
 Interstate sales       6.5%

It is obvious that  even the more realistic scenario would require strong 
MSEB, state government and regulator resolve.

In a separate e:mail I will describe the cost of service study we have also 
developed for MSEB.

Jane,

Attached is the latest summary (hard coded numbers, like I sent before) and

Just to confirm all that has changed are the customer categories and the MU's

Marla -

The best way to do this is by a side letter agreement.  That way we do not 
have to modify the existing document and only need to address the issue with 
those counterparties that raise it.  We can do the side letters from our 
office.  This needs to be coordinated with either me or Tana Jones.

Marla -

I appreciate the patience on the Password issue.   I realize it has been a 
while since we first spoke about this point. 

I have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the 
best we can do is insert language into the Password App. similar to that 
appearing in the attached document (which is the same type of language used 
in the ETA's).  It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper 
personnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an 
unauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not 
address the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon 
the counterparty.

Finally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any 
amendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or 
through Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have 
raised the issue should call either one of us if further action is 
necessary.  We do not actually revise the form agreements, but do provide 
side letters indicating modifications to the form agreement.

Once again, please accept my apologizes for the delay.  Let me know if you 
should need anything further.

Dear September Vincent,

Just a reminder that your current Reliant Energy HL&P statement is ready
for you to review at https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/  If you
participate in the Automatic Payment Plan (APP), your bank account will be
automatically drafted for the amount due.  Remember, with Auto Pay no
action is required to ensure your bill gets paid.
If you do not participate in Automatic Payment Plan (APP), you can pay
your bill immediately or schedule payment for a later date.  As with paper
bills your payment is due about 2 weeks from the statement date. The
online bill replaces your paper bill, a paper copy of your bill will not
be sent.

Should you need to modify your account information, go to
https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/  log into eBill and select User
Information. There you can update your information such as your email
address, change your password and add accounts.

As you use our eBill service, please do not hesitate to provide comments
through the Contact Us section of the site. Check out the Frequently Asked
Questions section for a quick reference.

Again, thank you for choosing Reliant Energy=01,s eBill service.

Please review the attached confirmation letter.  In order to apply the 
system's automated signature for Dana Davis, I couldn't change that area of 
the letter, but all the other changes should be there.  I do not have any of 
the information called for in the ""Payments to Counterpary"" section.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!

Don't get testy. I wasn't trying to get you upset.  I thought we were having 
a normal conversation.  It just didn't seem like you were talking as much as

Read too much into you???  How can I read too much into you when I don't know 
how to read you at all.  Half the time when you say something- I have no idea 
what you are really trying to say.

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Gary,

Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it 
helps.

1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global 
Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and 
the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that 
the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review 
process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that 
IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office 
of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly 
appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the 
next level that are IT executives.

3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the 
world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it 
always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place 
soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize 
it and change its culture"".

4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the 
business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, 
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated 
EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it 
for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was 
going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.

Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have 
any other questions.

Mike

Subject: Thanks and a few residual questions




Hello Mike,

Thanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. And
thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most 
interesting
and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a
few more questions?

1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you ""seeded
people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those
people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head."" So, 
at
that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed
thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT
organization for things such as standards, is that correct?

2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people
essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT 
organization?
Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two 
of
the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does 
any
given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT 
and
to a business unit?

3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you 
said
about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. 
Could
you repeat that?

4. You said: ""We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll
see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different."" 
What
did you mean by ""cannibalize our own business""?.

Thanks again.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-

Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

Kate

Subject: This was in the Miami Times this morning




By Leonard Pitts Jr.
                         Syndicated columnist

                         They pay me to tease shades of meaning from
social and cultural issues, to provide words that help make sense
                         of that which troubles the American soul. But
in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving
                         eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the
only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author
                         of this suffering.

                         You monster. You beast. You unspeakable
#######.

                         What lesson did you hope to teach us by your
coward's attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?
                         What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever
it was, please know that you failed.

                         Did you want us to respect your cause? You just
damned your cause.

                         Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled
our resolve.

                         Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought
us together.

                         Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast
and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, cultural, political
                         and class division, but a family nonetheless.
We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional
                         energy on pop cultural minutiae, a singer's
revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse.

                         We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready
availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that,
                         we walk through life with a certain sense of
blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -
                         peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to
know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming
                         majority of us, people of faith, believers in a
just and loving God.

                         Some people - you, perhaps - think that any or
all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not weak.
                         Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be
measured by arsenals.

                         Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and
we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the
                         awful thing you did, still working to make
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some
                         Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot
development from a Tom Clancy novel.

                         Both in terms of the awful scope of its
ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to
go
                         down as the worst acts of terrorism in the
history of the United States and, indeed, the history of the world.
                         You've bloodied us as we have never been
bloodied before.

                         But there's a gulf of difference between making
us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught
                         to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit
us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and
                         monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous
in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level
                         of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay
any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.

                         I tell you this without fear of contradiction.
I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me.
                         It also causes me to tremble with dread of the
future.

                         In days to come, there will be recrimination
and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed
                         this to happen and what can be done to prevent
it from happening again. There will be heightened security,
                         misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms.
We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But
                         determined, too. Unimaginably determined.

                         You see, there is steel beneath this velvet.
That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who
                         don't know us well. On this day, the family's
bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will weep, as Americans we
                         will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in
defense of all that we cherish.

                         Still, I keep wondering what it was you hoped
to teach us. It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to
                         know the depths of your hatred.

                         If that's the case, consider the message
received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my
                         people. You don't know what we're about. You
don't know what you just started.

                         But you're about to learn."

Steve,

I am calling Anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to Houston.
If he decides to stay in Houston, you should meet with him to convey
the concerns regarding his performance.

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your 
Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next 
year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we 
ran into this morning. If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or 
myself know and we'll address them as quickly as possible.

We will need a Unanimous Consent to make Kevin an Officer of the pipes, title should just be Vice President.    I think given the discussions over the weekend it would be good to do so effective last friday.

The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 10:00 in the January 19, 2002
Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 0:00 - 11:00, 13:00,
14:00 and 17:00 - 23:00 in
the January 19, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 20, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

		 Subject: industrial holdings investment-- arbitration proceeding

the arbitration proceeding filed with respect to this ena investment (which 
andrews and kurth filed for us), has been settled quickly in our favor with 
gail's assistance. this is the matter which we felt would not get actually 
litigated in the context of selection of counsel and wanted to confirm back 
this was the case.

Rogers --

Harry Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.  I think it's a great idea (Scott Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).  

My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.

Jim"

      Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation. 
Quite 
   a 
      meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts 
and 
   why 
      not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take 
pride 
   in 
      your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the 
game 
      tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.

    Attached are the most recent blacklines of the Declaration and Bylaws of
the Midway project.  The Articles did not change.  These changes were made
after discussions with Chris Boehler and Greg Krause.  Please let me know if
I may now send them to Scott Williams.  The only thing he may object to is
the lack of strong language guarantying the operation of the storm water
system in Paragraph 3.2.

Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

Dan,

The attached term sheet describes a gas sale we are proposing to the Eugene 
Water and Electric Board.  Please have a look and let me know how you think 
the actual confirm should look.  They have an Enfolio in legal review now.



Thanks,

Dave

> 
>     Dear Mr. President:
> 
>         We are writing because our constituents and millions of
> Americans across the West need your intervention at the Federal Energy
> Regulatory Commission (FERC) in order to address serious problems with the
> Western energy market. 
> 
>         As you know, California has been experiencing an electricity
> crisis that has resulted in blackouts throughout the state, inconvenienced
> millions of citizens and businesses, and disrupted the state's and
> region's economy.  Indeed, this crisis seriously threatens to cause
> long-term damage to the economy of California, the Western region, and
> perhaps the entire country.
> 
>         The crisis is the result of a dysfunctional energy market
> where wholesale prices of electricity have spiked exorbitantly.  For
> example, wholesale prices on December 15, 2000, ranged from $429 per Mwh
> to $565 per Mwh, compared to prices from $12 per Mwh to $29 per Mwh one
> year earlier.  Wholesale prices have jumped as high as $1400 per Mwh.  In
> fact, the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the state's power
> grid operator, has projected that electricity which cost $7 billion in
> 1999 will cost $70 billion this year.  These skyrocketing prices can only
> partly be explained by natural gas price increases and increased energy
> demand.
> 
>         These exorbitant price spikes have led FERC Commissioner
> William L. Massey to state on February 8, 2001:
> 
>         These high prices serve only to continue a massive wealth
> transfer out of the region.  Is it worth dragging down an entire regional
> economy, or perhaps even the national economy, for the theoretical purity
> of unfettered price signals?  I say no.  I call on my fellow commissioners
> to consider a time out now.  It's our statutory obligation. . . .  FERC's
> timidity  and hands-off approach is eroding consumer confidence and
> destroying the consensus that heretofore supported a market based
> approach.  
> 
> 
>         The dysfunctional nature of the market has apparently
> allowed it to be manipulated.  The California ISO last week presented FERC
> with findings of a comprehensive study of pricing data in California's
> wholesale electricity market over the last 10 months.  According to the
> Los Angeles Times, the ISO's study found ""evidence of market manipulation
> and consistent patterns of bidding far above costs"" and that ""suppliers
> commonly offered electricity at twice their costs.""  The ISO has estimated
> the cost of the potential overcharges between May 2000 and last month are
> high as $6.3 billion.    
> 
>         Unfortunately, FERC actions have fallen far too short.  To
> date, FERC has not aggressively worked to address market manipulations,
> despite finding last fall that wholesale prices were not ""just and
> reasonable.""  Nor is FERC apparently willing to seriously consider
> addressing runaway wholesale rates.
> 
>         The state of California is taking heroic measures, but this
> is an issue California cannot address alone.  In a February 28, 2001,
> meeting with the California delegation, FERC Chairman Curt Hebert
> confirmed the widespread understanding that the California market is not
> working.  He called the California market ""broken,"" and acknowledged the

> stated that ""I don't think there is any way California can pull itself out
> of this thing alone.""  As Mr. Hebert knows, California has no authority
> over wholesale electricity sales.  These sales fall solely within the
> jurisdiction of the federal government.
> 
>         Despite FERC's recognition that California cannot address
> this problem alone, FERC seems unwilling to assist California and the

support the Governors' request on wholesale rates, investigate the recent
allegations of overcharges, and act to prevent a dysfunctional electricity
market from damaging our constituents and a major engine of the nation's
economy.

                        Sincerely,   "

I got this message for a contractor that might be interested in working with 
us on the lateral.  Steve Thome had good luck with them on a water line and 
wanted to pass the name along.  He also called and mentioned a guy who is 
with an Enron affiliate - Northern Border - and is interested in a pipeline 
spur as well.  His phone number is 303-575-6479.  May be helpful to keep it 
in the Enron family.

Kim,
 
I wanted to forward you this email that I sent to Vince.  He had come back to Richard and I to resolve an issue with the dropping VaR associated with TW.  Vince was asking if this was related to the processes that we have automated. In speaking with Vernon, the date of the ERMS problem with the San Juan basis discussed below happened to coincide with the date or near proximity of the unwinding the Wholesale positions that TW had held. Consequently, there were substantial changes with the VaR increasing during this period.  When the rolling price data dropped off, it rolls for 30 days, the VaR decreased substantially.  If you have any questions please give me a call.

Vince,
 
I left you a message concerning the issue with the VaR.  The problem is associated with the ERMS Price that came on December 19.  The basis was .23 instead of -.23.  This is represented in SJ Price Quote File below. Consequently the inclusion of this date in the rolling 30 day bucket for the Historical Volatility calculation essentially changed the volatility for the entire Winter 2002-2003 strip.  Any I-I deal involving the San Juan was thus flawed and shown in the VaR.  
 
As this did occur on December 19th, this should have been caught in the December time period for any VaR report done on a daily basis since that time.  For example, the San Juan Historical Volatility was .395 on December 17, .394 on December 18, .521 on December 19 and .657 on December 20.  The VaR went up in the same way it came down-- on Feb 4 it was .66, on Feb 5 it was .52, on Feb 6 it was .357 and on Feb 7 it was .343.  This is shown in the attached file San Juan Hist Vol.
 
As Richard and I do the base calculations, which are correct, we would never catch this mistake.  We are somewhat surprised that when this volatility was included on December 19th the VaR report did not show a substantial increase from the previous day.  In the same way the VaR dropped by half, we would have expected it to double over a period of a couple of days in that week of December.
 
All in all, this issue took 10 hours for Richard and I to resolve.  As it is essentially out of the perview of setting up the SAS automation process--the process did run correctly, it was a little frustrating for us to devote the time to identifying this particular issue.  It would also appear to be a troubling issue from a financial perspective given the current Enron environment. 
 
I hope this resolves the problem.
 
Sean"

Jeff,

Diann Huddleson has spoken with PG&E on numerous occasions, and they have 
confirmed that effective as of January 19, 2001, they began using a Weighted 
Average cost of Generation/Purchase for the calculation of the PX amount.  I 
will coordinate between Tamara and the Services group which has this 
information and make sure everyone is on the same page.  I also support 
Tamara's desire to reconcile, at a tariff level, the curves to actual utility 
bills. 

Thanks,
Wanda

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara."

Finance & Economics
Houston, we have a problem

11/03/2001
The Economist
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economist; Source: World Reporter (TM) - FT McCarthy

The troubles of Enron, a Texan powerhouse in the energy markets, could result in a new financial crisis 
JUST last year, visitors to Enron's glittering headquarters in Houston were greeted by a giant banner that proclaimed the firm, ""The world's leading energy company"". That annoyed Enron's smaller energy-trading rivals, many of which have offices only a stone's throw away in Houston's Energy Alley, but not as much as what came next - a new banner, declaring Enron ""The world's leading company"". In recent weeks, as the company has been engulfed by a financial crisis, that banner has quietly been removed.
The heady mix of audacity, ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as any to Enron's remarkable rise and fall. Forged in the 1980s by the merger of two troubled gas-pipeline firms, Enron drove the development of the sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to dominate. Indeed, such is the scale of its operations, and its dealings with many of the world's financial institutions, that some observers see parallels with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the hedge fund that failed in 1998 - and not just because seemingly brilliant financial alchemists have been humbled. Were Enron to go bust - unlikely, but in the current nervous climate, not impossible - might a crisis ensue? 
Troubles in California's politically crazed power market, an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth trading and concerns about management badly dented Enron's share price earlier this year, prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling, the firm's newish chief executive, in August. Kenneth Lay, an avid free-marketeer, friend of George Bush and visionary chairman of the firm, was obliged to resume hands-on control. 
This has not slowed Enron's decline. Day by day, it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial quagmire that is largely of its own creation. Not least thanks to its lack of transparency, the firm's credibility with the markets has eroded to the point that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread. 
Enron's reputation for financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its third-quarter results came out in mid-October, showing a $1 billion write-off on water distribution, broadband trading and other investments. Worse, disclosed only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related private-equity fund called LJM. The charge was due to Enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer. Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal with LJM, a ""structured finance vehicle"". 
Enron's failure to offer details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear the worst about its huge balance sheet. Its shares plunged by 19% on October 30th alone (see chart on next page), before recovering a bit the next day. 
Andrew Fastow, who was replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th, was a general partner in LJM. Jeffrey McMahon, his successor, has much to do to restore confidence. Questions abound. Were the trusts run at arm's length? What did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership? Ominously, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now launched a formal inquiry. 
Moody's, a rating agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above ""junk"" level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet partnerships. Those known about, such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water, do not seem big enough to bankrupt Enron, but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles. 
A lower credit rating could destroy Enron's core franchise as the leading energy middleman, by scaring away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets. That might have nasty consequences in other markets. Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant in the derivatives market, holding a portfolio with a notional value of $21 billion. Rightly or wrongly, many traders believe that figure vastly understates Enron's presence. If the firms on the other side of Enron's trades start to fear that payment is not coming, they might curb their other trading, producing a knock-on effect. Where this could end up is a subject of much conjecture. 
Utilities that trade energy could be hit. So could the commodity and derivative operations of large commercial and investment banks. The ties are notably tight between Enron and J.P. Morgan Chase, according to Ventana Capital, a research firm. Not only does J.P. Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron; it also has the largest derivative operation of any bank, as well as a large business trading commodities. There is ""no doubt"" that Enron is on the other side of many J.P. Morgan trades, says Ventana. 
Were Enron to fail, Ventana thinks ""it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis"", worse, in some ways, than what occurred after LTCM. That merely froze the debt markets temporarily, whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks of the American economy. Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas, timber, coal, metals, fertiliser, bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals in. 
As yet, this all seems unlikely. Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week, although at shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past. Trading on EnronOnline was reportedly strong. Jim Donnell of Duke Energy, a big energy trader, described ""a huge dichotomy"" between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the equity and credit markets and the ""business as usual"" attitude taken by big commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty. 
Yet as questions about Enron's credit-standing spread this week, it began to have difficulty making markets in some instruments. Few firms would accept Enron's name as guarantor of a credit derivative. In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties refused the Enron name. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), two houses reportedly specified that they would not take Enron's credit. 
The biggest credit exposure appeared to be with banks, whose $3 billion of back-up lines to Enron were drawn down last week. J.P. Morgan arranged an additional $1 billion emergency credit-line this week. This back-up, it is widely assumed, is needed mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade. 
Too big to fail? 
Is Enron too big and too important to be allowed to fail? Philip Verleger, an energy economist, thinks that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced. Enron's rivals mostly disagree, unsurprisingly. 
But even Enron's worst enemies do not (yet) expect the firm to die from its current crisis. Most traders seem keen that it should live. ""Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader disappear,"" says one. They admire Enron's armies of traders and their ability to do deals. EnronOnline is one of the Internet's few success stories, assuming its huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits, as the firm claims. 
Enron's, and the financial system's, problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to meet its obligations. On the surface it is rich in assets, if not cash. But its lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt. In June 2000, The Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance, high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law. His response was revealing. To show that such charges were baseless, he pointed to another firm unfairly maligned by critics: Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank that rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s. Drexel was accused of arrogance, he groused, but it was only being ""very innovative and very aggressive"". Drexel was not bailed out: Michael Milken, its star, ended up in jail, and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and ignominy.

Enron Gets $1 Billion New Credit Line, But Must Pledge Top Gas-Pipeline Assets

Enron Corp. secured $1 billion in new credit lines, but had to pledge its best gas-pipeline assets as collateral. The deal did little to appease an important credit-rating agency. 
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group lowered its rating on Enron's long-term debt by one notch to triple-B from triple-B-plus and short-term debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2, citing a belief that Enron's planned sale of assets ""will be insufficient to restore its long-term credit quality"" to historic levels. Moody's Investors Service Inc. had issued debt downgrades earlier this week.
S&P also lowered ratings on the debt of Enron's pipeline systems, Transwestern Pipeline Co. and Northern Natural Gas Co., that were used to collateralize a $1 billion bank borrowing from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit. Enron said it would use the money from the 364-day credit lines to refinance roughly $250 million in maturing obligations, leaving it $750 million to boost short-term liquidity. 
In dropping the pipeline credit ratings by two notches, S&P noted that the assets have become ""more strategic to the company,"" in part because they can be relied upon to consistently make money, unlike many other Enron hard-asset investments. 
The pipelines produced $450 million in gas-transport revenue and an $85 million pretax profit in the third quarter on generally rising rates. That compared with revenue of $424 million for Enron's foreign assets that scraped by with a $19 million earnings contribution. 
Todd Shipman, credit analyst for S&P, said there have been concerns that Enron might take on too much debt, trying to prove it has enough cash on hand to meet its energy-trading obligations. But he said S&P wasn't worried by the most recent borrowing, because ""we don't think it will be a permanent part of the balance sheet."" However, he added that the amount of additional debt it can take on top of the $13 billion it now has outstanding is ""little to none."" With the sharp fall in its stock price, Enron's market capitalization is now around $10 billion. 
An Enron spokesman said ""it should be a nonissue"" because the company has no intention of borrowing more money anytime soon. 
In announcing the borrowing plan, Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said it was a move to ""enhance investor confidence."" But stock-market investors reacted otherwise and Enron stock gave up most of Wednesday's gain, closing at $11.99, down $1.91, or 14%, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. With many Enron bonds trading at two-thirds of their par value, bondholders didn't seem comforted either. 
Enron has been in a defensive posture since it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million two weeks ago, followed by news that it also took a $1.2 billion equity write-down, based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers. The company replaced its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, after the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into related-party transactions. Enron on Wednesday disclosed that the inquiry had been elevated to a formal probe.

Enron's Shares Fall and Debt Rating Is Cut
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DALLAS, Nov. 1 -- With investors absorbing news of a formal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit-rating agency, shares of the Enron Corporation fell 13.7 percent today, giving back most of the gains from Wednesday's rally. 
Late on Wednesday, Enron, the energy-trading giant based in Houston, said the S.E.C. had intensified its inquiry into the company's finances, making it a formal investigation, carrying subpoena power.
And today, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, leaving it a few notches above junk bond status. The downgrading came after a similar cut by Moody's Investors Service on Monday. S.& P. left Enron under review for a possible further downgrading. 
If Enron's credit rating were dropped below investment grade, it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy-trading concerns to curtail their business with Enron. 
S.& P. said that the company's ''financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' and that it had been unable ''to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business.'' But the rating agency also said it thought that ''Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty'' and that, so far, ''most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with Enron.'' 
This morning, Enron said it had obtained $1 billion in additional financing. The line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis. But some industry officials said investors might have reacted negatively because Enron had to pledge assets from two subsidiaries, Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline, to secure the credit line. 
An Enron spokeswoman said that she did not know what interest rates the credit lines carried and that the company had no plans to seek even more financing deals. 
Enron's shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the S.E.C. investigation and worries about off-balance-sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. Enron shares fell $1.91 today, to $11.99. 
Some analysts are beginning to attribute a swift recent rally in natural gas prices in part to the possibility that a collapse of Enron would roil the commodity markets. Enron dominates natural gas and electricity trading in the United States. 
In New York today, natural gas for December delivery fell 0.1 cent, to $3.29 for a million British thermal units. The contract has soared from about $2.70 over the last two weeks as Enron's troubles became public. 
''Enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities,'' said Jay Saunders, oil and gas analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, ''and if they're at risk financially, then you're exposed to that so you want to cover that risk. Anybody who has Enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid.'' 
Mr. Saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately, including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter.

California; Metro Desk
The State CalPERS Is Urged to Challenge Enron Finance: The public employee pension fund holds 3 million shares of the energy firm, whose stock has plunged. State senator calls for action.

SACRAMENTO -- A state senator has encouraged the managers of California's public employee retirement fund to challenge, perhaps with a lawsuit, the management of Enron Corp., the high-flying energy company whose stock has plummeted more than 80% in the last year. 
The California Public Employee Retirement System, the nation's biggest public pension fund, owns roughly 3 million shares of Enron common stock. Enron shares, once valued at nearly $85, fell $1.91 Thursday to $11.99 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) urged management of CalPERS to deal aggressively with the Houston-based company, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for a potential conflict of interest by its former chief financial officer. 
Investors have begun complaining of a paucity of information released by Enron about its financial transactions, and the stock has fallen dramatically in response. On Thursday, a major credit agency, Standard & Poor's, lowered its ratings on Enron, dealing the company another financial blow. 
""It is clear that the events surrounding Enron have created a serious lack of confidence in the judgment of Enron's management team,"" Peace wrote Tuesday in a letter to CalPERS Chief Executive James E. Burton. ""It is, therefore, incumbent on CalPERS, as trustee of public employees' ownership rights and as founder of the corporate governance movement, to improve Enron's corporate governance to increase share value."" 
In an interview, Peace said CalPERS should consider a shareholder lawsuit or join with other shareholders to force out Enron's management. CalPERS provides retirement and health benefits to more than 1.2 million state and local public employees and their families. 
Enron officials did not respond to a request for comment on Peace's letter. CalPERS officials said they were considering the letter. 
Peace has clashed repeatedly with Enron since the early 1990s, when the company was trying to influence the utility regulators and lawmakers forging a plan to turn California's regulated electricity industry into a competitive market. Peace chaired the legislative committee that crafted deregulation legislation. 
""Enron wants a market where consumers have limited knowledge, and they want to operate their business where stockholders have the most limited information possible,"" Peace said in an interview. 
Once a natural gas pipeline company, Enron has grown into the world's largest energy trader. 
Besides owning Enron stock, CalPERS has joined with the firm to invest in energy development. 
In 1993, CalPERS and Enron each contributed $250 million to an investment fund guided by Enron. When CalPERS ended the partnership in 1997 and sold its position to Enron, it earned $125 million, a 23% return, a CalPERS spokesman said. They teamed up again in 1998, with each putting up $500 million for energy industry investments. Enron tapped $150 million of CalPERS' money before CalPERS' commitment to the partnership expired.

Thanks to interest-free financing, General Motors and Ford Motor reported sharply higher October auto sales while Chrysler saw a more modest rise. GM reported that it sold 546,093 vehicles last month, a 31 percent increase over October 2000. Ford sold 400,893 vehicles in October, 36 percent more than the same month a year ago. Sales of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles were up 5 percent, with just more than 209,000 units sold. GM set an all-time monthly record for truck sales, while sales of Ford's beleaguered Explorer SUV set an October record. 
Enron Gets Loan -- at a Price
Enron received a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney but had to pledge its natural gas pipelines as collateral. Pledging the pipelines signals Enron's desperation to convince shareholders and trading partners that it's creditworthy as the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, investors said. Questions about Enron's dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Enron's dominant position is fuelling fears for markets: John Labate and Julie Earle consider the implications of the company's woes: 
Financial Times; Nov 2, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and JOHN LABATE

Nothing has added to Enron's growth more than its aggressive and dominant position in the trading markets for gas and electricity that the Houston-based company helped to create. 
A decade-long series of bold and innovative moves by Enron has not only changed the company but transformed the way US energy companies manage risk and trade energy products from region to region. 
On any given day Enron is the principal in about 25 per cent of the online and offline trades in the energy and natural gas markets, according to analysts' estimates. 
With an ongoing investigation by US securities regulators into Enron's accounting and disclosure practices, and Enron's market value falling by half in the past two weeks, many are wondering what impact Enron's mounting troubles could have on the trading markets. 
Analysts say that in the worst case, long-term scenarios, if Enron's debt is downgraded to junk status or if the company depletes its considerable cash resources, the energy and natural gas markets could be hit in multiple ways. 
""If you have something as big as Enron in a space saying they have no more money, you would have real effects and volatility in the market,"" said Todd Shipman, an analyst at credit rating agency Standard & Poor's. 
Few competitors want to see Enron exit the trading markets, however, since it provides so much liquidity to the markets, and fewer expect that to happen. 
Many of Enron's energy rivals, including Dynegy, Aquila and Duke Energy, are also trading partners, or counterparties to Enron. As such they may be closely tied to Enron's fate in the short term. 
The biggest near-term threat is if there is another change in Enron's credit status. 
This week Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron to two notches above junk status. Further reductions are, for the moment, the main worry among its rivals and trading partners, although Enron debt remains at investment-grade levels. 
""Certainly, whenever anybody is downgraded to junk status, their counterparties become concerned about how much credit they will extend,"" said Gerald Keenan, a partner at PWC Consulting in Chicago. 
""Everyone is re-evaluating their credit exposure to Enron but few companies have stopped trading with it. 
""It is often the counterparty of choice since it makes markets in areas where there is not a lot of liquidity."" 
Enron's trading partners are believed so far not to have changed the terms on their existing contracts with Enron. 
However, if Enron's financial status worsens, the lack of confidence could have its own negative impact on the energy trading markets. 
Existing market hedges between these multiple firms in the markets could begin to unwind, analysts warn, which could add to short-term instability in the energy marketplace. 
It is unlikely, however, that energy prices would be hit since terms would quickly be renegotiated and stability return to the trading markets. 
Any change in ownership in Enron could bring stability to the trading markets, say analysts.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Dollars 1bn line of credit secured to pay debt 
Financial Times; Nov 2, 2001
By ROBERT CLOW and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron, the troubled US energy trading group, has secured a Dollars 1bn credit line with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup arm, Salomon Smith Barney. 
Enron's management signalled last weekend that it expected to raise more cash to supplement the Dollars 3.3bn it received last week from drawing down its bank lines. 
The new loan will be secured against the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas company and Transwestern Pipeline. The proceeds will pay down maturing debt and increase short-term funds. 
Enron declined to comment on the terms and conditions of the deal, saying it was not yet closed. 
On Octoberm, 16 Enron management announced a Dollars 1.01bn charge and a Dollars 1.2bn reduction of shareholders equity as a result of off-balance sheet private equity transactions set up by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer. 
Those deals raised questions about whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of Enron's other shareholders, which became the basis for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. 
If the credit rating agencies downgrade the company's debt further, counterparties might increase the collateral they require to trade with Enron. That could squeeze the embattled company's profit margins still further. 
It is not yet clear how the rating agencies will react to Enron borrowing against its pipeline assets. Their stable revenues have been one of the cornerstones of Enron's rating. 
In an effort to safeguard its ratings, a senior management delegation told all the rating agencies on Wednesday that it was going to be retreating from risk taking. 
""We are going to explore new markets,"" the company said. ""But what we have learned that we can expand into new markets without making large expenditures."" www.ft.com/energy

WORLD STOCK MARKETS: Wall St buoyed by Microsoft peace talks 
Financial Times; Nov 2, 2001
By MARY CHUNG

US equities overcameearly hesitancy to risedecisively by midday as investors shrugged off grim manufacturing data and focused on Microsoft's tentative agreement to settle its antitrust battle with the government. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 67.59 at 9,142.73 and the S&P 500 index 8.60 at 1,068.38. The Nasdaq Composite rose 23.66 at 1,713.86. 
Investors cheered news that the US Justice Department and Microsoft had agreed the outline of a settlement requiring the world's largest software company to give computer manufacturers more freedom in the design of Windows desktops. 
Microsoft rose 4 per cent at Dollars 60.54 and gave a boost to the technology sector as shares in Oracle added 2 per cent Dollars 13.79, Cisco climbed 1.4 per cent at Dollars 17.15 and Sun Microsystems gained 4 per cent at Dollars 10.55. 
Chip stocks were broadly higher, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 4 per cent. Shares in Intel tacked on 2.2 per cent at Dollars 24.97 and Advanced Micro Devices climbed 6.3 per cent at Dollars 10.46. 
The sector was boosted by an industry report showing the third consecutive month of smaller declines for chip sales. Stocks had flirted in negative territory after more disappointing economic data painting a bleak picture for the US economy. 
The National Association of Purchasing Management data showing factory activity fell to a nine-year low in October. 
The data followed a report from the labour department showing the number of Americans requesting unemployment insurance benefits on an ongoing basis rose to the highest since May 1983. 
Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets, said he was encouraged by the market's ability to bounce back from negative news. 
""Even when bad news happens, there's initial weakness then the market bounces back,"" he said. 
However, woes continued for Enron, the embattled energy trading company, which fell 9.4 per cent at Dollars 12.59 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission upgraded its probe into the company's accounting methods to a formal investigation. 
United Airlines rose 2 per cent at Dollars 13 in spite of a third-quarter loss of Dollars 1.16bn. 
Eastman Kodak rebounded 2 per cent at Dollars 26.07 after seeing heavy losses this week amid an analyst downgrade and a cut in its debt rating by Moody's Investor Service. 
Toronto was flat in late morning trade and by midsession the TSE-300 composite index was just 8.30 higher at 6,894.00. 
Banks bucked the weaker trend. Bank of Nova Scotia jumped 60 cents to CDollars 44.45 and Bank of Montreal was 33 cents higher at 34.19.

Enron gets $1 billion more 
Pledging assets, credit downgrade bruise shares 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s bid to shore up investor confidence by announcing it had lined up $1 billion in credit didn't succeed Thursday. 
Shares in Houston's largest company closed down $1.91 at $11.99. And that was before a second rating agency downgraded Enron's credit ratings. 
The action by Standard & Poor's wasn't a surprise to Wall Street and isn't likely to help Enron's sagging shares. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Thursday morning it had reached a deal with the investment banking units of Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. for $1 billion in credit lines to be backed by a significant portion of Enron's pipeline assets. 
Last week, Enron tapped into a $3.3 billion revolving credit line that wasn't secured by collateral. It banked about $1.1 billion and is using the rest to pay off short-term debt obligations. 
Investors reacted Thursday to several pieces of news. 
One was Wednesday night's disclosure by Enron that federal securities regulators are formally investigating business dealings between Enron and investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who Enron removed last week as chief financial officer. 
Since Enron revealed two financial hits related to the investment partnerships on Oct. 16, Wall Street has raised an expanding number of questions about its financial health. Some investors also saw the fact that Enron's new credit will be asset-backed as negative. 
""What it tells you is that now they have to start using the crown jewels as security,"" said Donald Coxe, chairman of Harris Investment Management, where the Harris Insight Equity Fund owns about 78,000 shares in Enron. ""Any royal family which has to pledge the crown and scepter to get a loan in the private markets tends to be about three days from the republicans breaking down the barriers of the palaces."" 
But Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said using the assets as collateral meant Enron could get the credit negotiated quickly. 
""It has to do with speed,"" he said, adding that Enron sought to reassure outsiders its balance sheet is strong and that it has available cash to support its core energy trading business. 
Of the new credit, which is expected to be finalized shortly, $250 million will be used to pay off debt obligation that's about to mature. The rest will be available as cash, Palmer said. 
The assets of its Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., the collateral Enron pledged could support another $200 million in credit if need be, he said, adding that Enron didn't believe it needed more than $1 billion. 
Enron, which transformed itself from a pipeline company to a trader in everything from electricity to paper, still has about 25,000 miles of pipelines. The two assets pledged represent more than 19,000 miles of that. 
Monday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt one level to a rating that's still two notches above what are commonly called junk bonds. 
Thursday, Standard & Poor's did the equivalent. It is also downgraded Enron's short-term ratings and said it was reviewing the company for potential additional downgrades. 
If Enron's credit ratings fall from investment grade to junk status, it will trigger a wave negative consequences, including some that would damage its trading business. 
Part of Enron's purpose in setting up new credit is to help it keep an investment-grade rating. 
In its report, S&P said it downgraded Enron because it believes the company's plans, including asset sales, won't be enough to warrant the credit rating Enron had. It expressed concerns that Enron could face some permanent erosion of its share of the energy trading market if its main competitors take advantage of its weakened state and could have trouble keeping key personnel. 
Carol Coale, a stock analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, said in a report Thursday that Enron may need to issue 120 million new shares or more ""to keep the rating agencies at bay."" 


USA: WRAPUP 2-Enron lines up cash to soothe worried Wall Street.
By Jeff Franks

11/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., gathering money to soothe a worried Wall Street, lined up $1 billion of new credit on Thursday, then saw its credit rating cut for a second time this week as the nation's largest energy trader struggled to restore investor confidence shaken by questionable financial transactions. 
Shares in the Houston-based company, whose dealings are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, tumbled $1.91, or 13.7 percent, to $11.99 as the market continued a two-week-long pummeling of the stock.
At issue are off-the-balance sheet deals with limited partnerships, run by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, which contributed to a $1 billion charge against third quarter earnings and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity announced on Oct. 16. Angry investors say Enron has not fully explained the transactions or whether it faces more liabilities. 
The company, taking the tack that an having abundance of money available would ease fears about its financial stability, said on Thursday it got $1 billion in credit lines from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc. 
The new credit, which comes on top of $3.3 billion in lines that Enron tapped last week, came with the proviso that the company's gas and pipeline assets be put up as collateral, a measure usually reserved for firms with ""junk"" credit ratings. 
ALLAY FEARS 
But a grateful Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, thanked the two Wall Street institutions for their support and said the credit infusion should help allay investors' fears. 
""We very much appreciate the support of two of our long-standing banking partners,"" he said in a statement. ""With more than $1 billion in cash currently on our balance sheet, this additional credit capacity will further solidify Enron's standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets."" 
The good news was tempered later in the day by Standard & Poor's announcement that it had cut Enron's credit rating and could do so again if the situation worsens. 
The rating agency cut Enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to ""BBB,"" two notches above junk status, from ""BBB-plus,"" its subordinated debt rating to ""BBB-minus"" from ""BBB,"" and its commercial paper rating to ""A-3"" from ""A-2."" 
It also downgraded ratings for several Enron share trusts. 
Downgrades could make it harder for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. If the ratings fall to junk, or below investment-grade, Enron could be forced to issue more shares, analysts said. 
S&P said it cut the ratings because of questions about whether Enron was taking sufficient action to fully restore its credit quality. 
""The company's financial flexibility has continued to diminish. This crisis of investor confidence can be traced ... directly to the company's inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business and the viability of the company's plan to restore its credit profile,"" it said. 
FULL DISCLOSURE 
""A full, frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in Enron securities,"" the agency added. 
S&P nevertheless said Enron's liquidity position is ""adequate"" to see the company through its current problems and that Enron was unlikely to see its position as the industry's top energy marketer endangered as long as it operated transparently. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service cut Enron's long-term debt to ""Baa2,"" also two notches above junk, and warned it may cut that rating and Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating. 
Enron was once a Wall Street darling lauded for its ability to create new Internet-based commodity markets that produced soaring profits and a stock price that seemed to defy gravity. 
But setbacks in its bandwidth business and overseas investments, plus problems arising from the California power crisis hurt its do-no-wrong image. And in August, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling shocked the financial world by resigning after just six months on the job, citing personal reasons. 
The stock, whose year-high was $84, began to sink, then fell off a cliff after the company's Oct. 16 announcement. That day, shares closed at $33.84. 
Trying to shore up its credibility, Enron replaced Fastow last week with another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon. 
The company said on Wednesday an SEC ""informal inquiry"" begun Oct. 22 had become a formal investigation, possibly indicating regulators did not like what they had seen. It elected University of Texas law school dean William Powers to the board of directors and put him in charge of an internal probe into the deals. 
Despite all the bad news of recent weeks, Enron said on Thursday its core business of energy trading was going strong. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode said transactions on the Houston-based company's widely watched Internet EnronOnline system were averaging some $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day average of $2.5 billion. 
Enron is by far the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trader, with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets.

ENRON CORP.: Credit rating cut again; $1 billion secured

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

Troubled Enron Corp. said Thursday it has secured $1 billion in new financing, but then saw its credit rating cut for the second time this week and watched its stock price take another dive. 
Enron said it got $1 billion in credit lines from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., but had to put up its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral.
Standard & Poor's cut its ratings for Enron, downgrading its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB, two notches above junk status. Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's long-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped nearly 14 percent, or $1.91 per share, to close at $11.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. After dropping to a nine-year low Tuesday, shares of the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent Wednesday amid speculation the company was a takeover candidate. 
But after the markets closed Wednesday, Enron announced the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into possible conflicts of interest. The SEC is apparently looking into dealings Enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was forced out last week. 
Late Wednesday, Enron said it created a special committee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors.

India ONGC Plans Enron Oil,Gas Field Bid If BG Deal Fails

11/02/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- India's state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) said Friday that it would consider bidding for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) upstream Indian assets if U.K.-based BG Group PLC's (BRG) conditional acquisition of the assets collapses. 
BG paid $388 million for Enron's 30% stake in oil and gas fields offshore western India, but the sale is subject to a number of consents and conditions including confirmation from Enron and Gas India's joint venture partners - ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) - that BG will inherit field operator status from Enron.
ONGC and Reliance Industries are challenging BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field. BG have made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship. 
""If BG wants to walk away, we'll come up with a plan. If they (Enron) offer (an opportunity to bid again), yes, then we will think about it,"" an ONGC spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires, without elaborating further. 
Earlier this year, ONGC bid a reported $400 million for Enron's Indian oil and gas assets, only to have its bid rejected. Analysts at the time said Enron was unlikely to settle for anything less than $600 million for its stake in the venture. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets. 
As reported Thursday, BG said it will extend the negotiation period on the operatorship of the fields for an unspecified period. 
However, analysts say BG's bid for operator status will continue to face stiff resistance from ONGC and Reliance. 
""We want the operatorship,"" the ONGC spokesman reiterated. 
Enron's upstream oil and gas assets in India hold proven and probable reserves of around 170 million barrels of oil equivalent.

Enron May Sell India Dabhol Power Shr At Discount-Lender

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) may sell its equity in India's 2,184 megawatt Dabhol Power Co. plant at a discount given its financial woes back home, a senior official of the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB) told Dow Jones Newswires. 
""There's a possibility of Enron selling its equity in Dabhol real cheap because that company desperately needs cash. Anything below $500 million will be a good price to pay for their Dabhol stake,"" said the IDBI official.
India's banks and financial institutions have a total exposure of about $1.4 billion in the Dabhol power plant, located in the western India state of Maharashtra. IDBI's own exposure in Dabhol is in excess of 20 billion rupees ($1=INR48.00). 
Enron has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. Back in August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 
Enron India spokesman Jimmy Mogal confirmed that Dabhol Power Co. was currently in talks with the government and Indian financial institutions but declined to say what price Enron was seeking. 
""DPC continues to hold discussions with the government of India and Indian financial institutions regarding the sale of foreign sponsor equity in the Dabhol project. It would not be appropriate to elaborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the status of these buyout discussions,"" Mogal said in a faxed reply to questions. 
""While we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue, DPC continues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in order to protect the interests of DPC's stake holder,"" he added. 
R.K. Pachauri, director of the independent think tank Tata Energy Research Institute, said the time was right for a company to negotiate a bargain from cash-strapped Enron for its Dabhol equity. 
""Even $700 million would be a good price. All said and done, Dabhol is a world class project. People now need to get their act together and settle for a deal since the time is fast running out,"" Pachauri said. 
The Houston-based Enron is attempting to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its financial position after a precipitous fall in its share price. Last week, the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion in credit after it encountered difficulties in raising funds in the commercial paper market. 
The IDBI official said Enron's Indian lenders don't see any logic in buying out its equity in Dabhol because they don't want a non-performing asset. 
But he said one possible option being talked about was the state-owned company National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) buying Enron's stake. 
""The government has to decide fast who will buy this equity. A state-owned company like the National Thermal Power Corp., which has core competence in the power sector, may be asked to buy Enron's stake. Later, NTPC can always resell it at a higher price,"" the official said. 
Local newspapers say India's privately-owned BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) and Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) may also be interested in buying out Enron's Dabhol stake. 
No Tata Power official was immediately available for comment and a BSES official declined to comment when reached by Dow Jones Newswires. 
The IDBI official said he hoped the government will take a decision before Nov. 9 when the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visits the U.S. to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. 
He said Enron may send a final contract termination notice to MSEB any time after Nov. 19 and then the dispute will have to be settled by the Court of Arbitration in London. 
""Should India lose the case, it may have to pay Enron damages ranging anywhere between $4 billion-$5 billion. Enron has a history of not losing any litigation,"" he warned. 
Local media reports over the past two months have said Enron wants $1.00 billion for its stake in Dabhol. 
A senior India power ministry official said the government favored an early solution to the Dabhol crisis but added that no decision had been taken yet on who would buy Enron's equity. 
""We are committed toward resolving the Dabhol dispute amicably. Talks are on and nothing definite has been decided yet. But I am hopeful, the dispute will end on a happy note, sometime very soon,"" said the government official. 
Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment. MSEB has 15%, while General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each.

`Buying out Enron's stake in Dabhol unit won't help'

11/02/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Buying out Enron's stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is no resolution since the tariff will still be unviable, analysts say. 
Even as Enron Corp is preparing to sell off its stake in the project to Indian financial institutions, who have lent huge sums to the project, experts say a buy-out would make sense only if the bid for Enron's share of $ 1.3 billion is discounted to under $ 500 million and the loan component is written off by at least $ 500 million, says convenor of the Enron Virodhi Andolan, Pradyumna Kaul.
``The project will continue to be unviable even after buying it at low cost,'' Mr Kaul asserts. ``If LNG is the fuel, the energy price will still be more than Rs 2 per unit, given the fact that oil will be more than 25 per barrel. This will ensure that the unit cost of power will never be less than Rs 3.20,'' he says. 
At the moment, Enron is willing to sell power at Rs 3.60 per unit at 90 per cent offtake, he points out. But this is not possible because a high offtake will not be permitted by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission in the absence of demand. The MERC has told the state eletricity board to buy costliest power the last. ``And at a low offtake, the plant will be grossly unviable,'' an expert says. 
Apart from buying Enron's stake at a low cost, it is necessary to reduce interest rates from Indian FIs, slash customs duty and sales tax on fuel, he says. These are some of the demands that DPC has already placed before the govermment. ``Even if the plant is sold, these factors will hike up the cost,'' he said. 
Another alternative is to use the plant for peaking load alone, to be used only during a few hours of the day. This would bring down costs, anti-Enron activist Abhay Mehta said. In practical terms, he said, the only player to benefit from a sale is Enron Corp which is desperately looking to sell its stake. 
Such a prospect leaves some grey areas about the future of the judicial inquiry ordered recently by the Democratic Front government. The probe is yet to get under way and the supreme court case against the project is pending hearing. 
While officials admit that legally the actions will continue, it will not be as effective as if the company is still in the field. It is also possible to come to a mutually acceptable settlement before Enron exits the country or speed up the actions, they say. 
``These repercussions are secondary; the moot point is a speedy solution to the Enron issue,'' says an official. 
Mr Mehta says the fact that chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already agreed to an extension for the judicial probe beyond six months, ``if it is found necessary'' suggests that the government ``is not really serious about solving the issue but will rather keep dragging the case till the chickens come home to roost and some political points are scored.'' 
``The state government's attitude is like that of an ostrich: if you ignore a problem long enough, it will go away,'' he says.

Dabhol lenders' meet in London cancelled

The meeting of the lenders of the Enron-promoted Dabhol power project scheduled for November 2 and 3 in London has been cancelled. 
This was supposed to be the last meeting of the lenders before the November 19 deadline by which the Dabhol Power Company is required to fire its final termination notice.
Sources in the domestic as well as the global lenders consortium confirmed the cancellation of the meeting, but gave conflicting reasons for this. Some domestic lenders maintained that the meeting was postponed because a solution to the Dabhol problem was in sight. ""The government is working out a solution to the problem along with the domestic financial institutions,"" they said. 
""It only makes sense to meet after the solution is worked out,"" said a source in the domestic lenders consortium. 
This was sharply contested by a source in the foreign lenders consortium who said that the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) chairman & managing director P P Vohra and ICICI chief executive officer K V Kamath were to attend the meeting, but their last minute engagements resulted in the cancellation of the meeting.

USA: Critics question Andersen's handling of Enron.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

11/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Andersen, a top accounting firm, should have done more as auditor for energy giant Enron Corp. to alert investors to certain partnerships tied to the company that are now being investigated by U.S. authorities, accounting experts said on Thursday. 
As the Houston-based energy trading group dealt with a deepening crisis, critics of its auditor Andersen said the accountants should have pushed harder for more and clearer disclosure of the partnerships' potential for conflicts of interest and financial risk to Enron.
""Not only is the disclosure seemingly inadequate as to where it's put, it's inadequate as to the attention that's paid to it. Then thirdly, it's almost unintelligible,"" said Mark Cheffers, who heads Massachusetts-based accounting consultancy AccountingMalpractice.com, in an interview. 
Enron, whose share price slumped again on Thursday, said on Wednesday that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the top U.S. financial markets regulator. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. 
Enron last month ousted its chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was instrumental in setting up and managing certain outside partnerships that have been linked to the SEC probe. 
Enron's ties to the partnerships were disclosed in Enron reports to the SEC and investors. Andersen, based in Chicago, audited those reports and approved them as fair and complete. 
Asked about criticisms of the job the firm did, Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said: ""We are committed to quality auditing and protecting the investor interest. Knowledgeable parties are looking at these matters. We're not going to respond to speculative commentary."" 
Enron disclosed in its March 2001 proxy statement that in the year 2000 it paid Andersen $25 million in auditor fees, as well as $27 million in fees for various other work. 
Enron - a former natural gas pipeline group that transformed itself into the nation's largest energy trader - saw its stock close down on Thursday near an eight-year low, having lost two-thirds of its value since mid-October. 
Investors began dumping Enron shares after reports of off-the-balance sheet transactions involving two limited partnerships run by Fastow, who was replaced last week by another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon. 
FASTOW'S DUAL ROLE SEEN AT HEART OF CONTROVERSY 
How Fastow could have balanced his duties as Enron CFO with his role as head of the partnerships - which regularly did business with Enron - is the key question, sources said. 
The partnerships - called LJM2 Co-Investment LP and LJM Cayman LP - were set up expressly to do huge volumes of highly complex financial transactions wi???stow's employer. The transactions were disclosed to Enron investors in annual 10K filings and pr???2000 and 2001. 
But Andersen should have done more to put the disclosures in plain English and highlight their potential for possible conflicts and risk to Enron's finances, said critics. 
Enron last month said it was taking a $1 billion charge against earnings, as well as cutting shareholder equity by $1.2 billion due to transactions with the Fastow-led entities. 
""A firm of Andersen's magnitude and reputation should always be aware of such possibilities. They should be able to presuppose the what-ifs in any condition,"" said Jay Nisberg, an accounting consultant based in Ridgefield, Connecticut. 
An Enron spokeswoman said Andersen knew about the LJM partnerships. ""We made them aware of our transactions with the partnerships and they reviewed them to the extent they deemed necessary,"" said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
Even investors in the partnerships, which by most accounts were tremendously profitable, questioned how they were set up, with Enron employee Fastow at their head. 
One early investor in LJM2 was the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, a pension fund with $8 billion in assets. zz zz.

Enron: Online Trading Volume Sees Normal Decline Thursday

11/01/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) electronic trading system, EnronOnline.com, saw a little more than 6,600 transactions Thursday, down from Wednesday's 7,100 transactions, Enron spokesman Eric Thode said. 
The decline is typical of a reduction in energy trading activity at the beginning of the month, said Thode, who added that EnronOnline volume Oct. 1 was 5,200 deals. As in the past two weeks, the volume of transactions Thursday exceeded the 30-day average volume of about 5,600 daily transactions.
""All companies were transacting that we would expect to be transacting,"" Thode said. 
On Thursday, energy traders said EnronOnline, on which Enron is the counterparty for all deals, was less active. At one key western electricity hub, Palo Verde, Ariz., EnronOnline's bid to buy power for delivery in December was $34.35 a megawatt-hour, compared with the best bid of $34.50 a megawatt-hour on the IntercontinentalExchange, a competing Internet-based trading system. EOL's offer to sell the same contract was 35 cents higher. EOL's bid-offer spreads were also wider for Northeast power and western gas at midday Thursday, though they were competitive for Northeast gas. 
Generally, EOL presents tighter spreads in its key markets than the spreads found either on competing electronic systems or in the phone-broker market. Those aggressive bids have helped propel volumes on EOL since its inception in November 1999. 
""Spreads fluctuate based on the markets. Every company has different perceptions,"" Thode said when asked about the narrower spreads on EOL. 
""The power market for the past two weeks has been fairly quiet. There's been little volatility. Gas markets fairly volatile, and the increased volumes have come from primarily natural gas markets,"" Thode said.

Power supplier Enron's stock drops another 14 percent
By MARK BABINECK
Associated Press Writer

11/01/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Troubled Enron Corp. said Thursday it has secured $1 billion in new financing, using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral. But its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation. 
In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares fell nearly 14 percent, or $1.91 a share, to $11.99.
After dropping to a nine-year low on Tuesday, shares of the nation's largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent Wednesday amid speculation the Houston-based company was a takeover candidate. 
But after the stock market closed for the day, Enron, an important supplier to power-starved California, announced the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest. 
The SEC is apparently looking into dealings Enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements. 
While referring to the latest SEC news as ""noise,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Donato J. Eassey said it would subdue Enron's stock price. 
""We believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap Enron's stock price in the mid-teens while increasing overall volatility,"" Eassey said in a note Thursday. 
Late Wednesday, Enron said it created a special committee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors. 
""I have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors' questions and concerns,"" said Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth L. Lay. ""We will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the SEC's investigation."" 
However, Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. in New York, said Enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence. 
""With (stock) values this low, you've got two camps of investors: guys that hate Enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to Enron,"" Grubert said. ""It's led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold. It's not something the company wants."" 
Enron's stock has skidded since the company reported a $638 million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago, dragged down by a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to various losses. Some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by Fastow, who was ousted last week. 
Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's long-term debt and warned of possible further downgrades. 
On Tuesday, shares hit a nine-year low of $11.16. With such a depressed stock price, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron was being eyed as a possible takeover target. 
Potential buyers include General Electric's GE Capital unit, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Royal Dutch Shell, the Journal said.

USA: UPDATE 1-S&P cuts Enron ratings, may cut ratings again.

11/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Thursday cut its ratings for embattled energy trader Enron Corp. and warned it may cut the ratings again because of what it described as ""uncertainties"" surrounding the company and the possibility it may face further problems in the capital markets. 
Houston-based Enron said on Wednesday it is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Downgrades could make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business as fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. If the ratings fall to junk, or below investment-grade, Enron could be forced to issue more shares. 
S&P cut Enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to ""BBB,"" two notches above junk status, from ""BBB-plus,"" its subordinated debt rating to ""BBB-minus"" from ""BBB,"" and its commercial paper rating to ""A-3"" from ""A-2."" 
The rating agency also downgraded ratings for several Enron share trusts. 
S&P warned it may cut all of these ratings again. A downgrade to the commercial paper rating would take that rating to junk status. All leading U.S. rating agencies, including S&P, generally rate all of a company's senior unsecured debt and commercial paper either investment-grade or junk. 
S&P nevertheless said Enron's liquidity position is ""adequate"" to see the company through its current problems. 
So long as Enron provides market participants with their usual liquidity and price transparency, it said, ""it is unlikely that any significant long-term damage to Enron's franchise as the premier energy marketer will be sustained."" 
The S&P analyst who covers Enron was not immediately available for further comment. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service cut Enron's long-term debt to ""Baa2,"" also two notches above junk, and warned it may cut that rating and Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating. 
Enron shares closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $11.99, down $1.91, or 13.7 percent. They have fallen 65 percent since Oct. 16, when Enron said it would take $1.01 billion in charges for certain investments. The shares hit a nine-year low on Tuesday. 
""CRISIS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE"" 
S&P said Enron's plan to sell assets and use other means to repair its ""damaged balance sheet"" will be ""insufficient"" to restore its historical ""BBB-plus"" ratings. 
""This crisis of investor confidence can be traced ... directly to the company's inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business and the viability of the company's plan to restore its credit profile,"" it said. 
""A full, frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in Enron securities,"" S&P added. 
Enron said on Thursday it obtained $1 billion in secured credit lines in a bid to help support day-to-day trading operations and bolster investor confidence. 
""We are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating,"" said Jeffrey McMahon, who last week became Enron's new chief financial officer, in a statement issued on Thursday.

Enron's Credit Rating Cut After $1 Bln Loan Secured (Update9)
2001-11-01 18:27 (New York)

Enron's Credit Rating Cut After $1 Bln Loan Secured (Update9)

     (Adds company comment in 17th to 19th paragraphs.)

     Houston, Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, received a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. after agreeing to use the
company's natural-gas pipelines as collateral.

     Enron shares fell 14 percent a day after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission began formally investigating partnerships
run by its former chief financial officer. Pledging the pipelines
signals Enron's desperation to convince shareholders and trading
partners that it's creditworthy, investors said.

     ``It's not reassuring, it's worrisome,'' said Donald Coxe,
manager of the Harris Insight Equity Fund, which owns about 78,000
Enron shares. ``If they had to secure the loan, obviously the
lenders don't think they can rely on Enron's financial
statements.''

     Standard & Poor's said after U.S. markets closed that it cut
Enron's long-term credit rating to ``BBB,'' the second-lowest
investment grade, from ``BBB+.'' Its short-term debt rating was
cut to ``A-3,'' one grade above junk status, from ``A-2.'

     The SEC is investigating partnerships run by former CFO
Andrew Fastow that bought and sold Enron shares and assets. Those
trades cost Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity. Questions about Enron's dealings with the partnerships
have shut it out of commercial-paper markets, where most large
corporations go to find low-interest, short-term debt.

     Last Friday, Enron tapped a $3 billion credit line to pay off
$2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding. Proceeds from
the $1 billion secured loan will go for debt payments and to
supplement cash reserves, Enron said.

                        Business With Enron

     To get the $1 billion loan, Enron pledged assets of its
Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., which own
gas pipeline systems that combined are about 19,000 miles long and
can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic feet of gas a day.

     Enron, based in Houston, got its start as a natural gas-
pipeline operator. Over the past decade, the company has shed
assets such as pipelines and power plants and focused on trading
electricity, gas, wood pulp and other commodities.

     Enron now accounts for about a quarter of U.S. power and gas
trades. The company still has about 25,000 miles of gas pipeline.

     Mortgaging those lines is ``maybe not such a good signal,''
said Roger Hamilton, who manages John Hancock Value funds, which
owns 600,000 Enron shares. ``It shows they can't convince banks
with anything but secured assets.''

     Shares of Enron fell $1.91 to $11.99. Earlier, they dropped
to $11.70. The stock has fallen 86 percent this year.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell about 3
cents today to be bid at 74 cents on the dollar and offered at 77
cents, traders said. Until last week, the notes were trading near
par value.

                           Credit Rating

     Enron must have investment-grade credit to borrow enough to
settle its transactions daily. Energy companies including Exelon
Corp. and Northeast Utilities have restricted business with Enron
as the company sought new sources of credit.

     On Monday, Moody's Investors Service lowered Enron's long-
term credit rating to ``Baa2'' from ``Baa1,'' two notches above
junk status. It also placed the company's ``P-2'' rating for
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade.

     Standard & Poor's said in downgrading Enron's credit rating
today that the company has enough liquidity to see it through the
``current period of uncertainty.'' Still, S&P said, Enron's
``financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' because of its
``inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength
of Enron's core energy marketing business.''

                         Repayment Trigger

     Falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment
terms for $3.3 billion in bonds held by affiliated companies such
as the ones created by Fastow. A lower credit rating also reduces
the amount of cash that Enron can raise to back its trading
business.

     ``There are still two levels before those triggers go into
effect,'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said. The announcement of
today's $1 billion loan is ``the latest step in an orderly plan to
strengthen our balance sheet,'' she said. Denne outlined three
steps, which include the credit line and a draw-down of $3 billion
in unsecured credit, which was announced last week.

     The final step is $2.1 billion in asset sales, which the
company outlined on a conference call last week. Enron said it
expects to close on $600 million in sales before year's end.

     The sales include Enron's Azurix North America water business
to American Water Works Inc. for $149.8 million, Enron's Puerto
Rican power-plant company EcoElectrica Holdings Ltd. to Mirant
Corp. and Enron's stake in Brazilian natural-gas distributor Cia.
Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro to state-owned Brazilian
oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras. The latter two
transactions are valued at $250 million each, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

     S&P said today it doesn't think the asset sales and Enron's
other plans will be enough to restore Enron's credit quality to
the ``BBB+'' level it had since 1995.

                        Investor Confidence

     The financing is to ``enhance market and investor
confidence,'' Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said
in a statement.

     Enron can borrow another $200 million by bringing other banks
into the loan, Denne said. ``We don't have any plans to do so at
this point,'' she said.

     ``We are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating,'' McMahon said.

     McMahon, then head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO last week. Fastow was ousted in an attempt to restore
investor confidence.

     ``It seems until we know more about the SEC investigation,
it's going to be a difficult time for the stock,'' said Tara
Gately, an energy analyst at Loomis Sayles & Co., which sold most
of its Enron shares early last year.

     J.P. Morgan is advising Enron on the sale of part of Azurix.
Salomon Smith Barney is the investment-banking arm of Citigroup
Inc.

USA: Enron U.S. energy trade so far skirts credit woes.
By Joseph Silha

11/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., whose shares slumped again on Thursday amid investors' concerns over a credit crunch, has yet to see that fear seriously dent its dealings with other giants of the U.S. gas and power markets. 
""Trading volumes in our core wholesale businesses remain extremely strong. Every day this week, volume on EnronOnline has exceeded our rolling 30-day average. We are not seeing people hesitate to do business with us,"" Enron spokesman Eric Thode said.
Enron is by far the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trader, with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets. 
The company recently became the target of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. 
Thode said transactions on the Houston-based company's widely watched Internet EnronOnline system were averaging some $3 billion to $4 billion a day, up from a 30-day average of $2.5 billion. 
BUSINESS AS USUAL? 
While Enron's dominance of the industry has long been a sore spot with competitors, many of its biggest trading partners said it was business as usual, despite an 80 percent plunge in the company's share price since January. 
But the drain on the company's capital has not gone unnoticed, prompting increased caution among traders but few fears the company will exit the North American energy market. 
""Enron has come under closer scrutiny, but we haven't changed our policy about dealing with the company. This is a one time event. It's a hurricane, but it doesn't mean the weather next year will be bad. Enron will handle this problem,"" Al Butkus, vice president at UtiliCorp United, said. 
Butkus noted Enron's problems stem from how the company financed the purchase of some assets, not from its trading operations. 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, another large trading partner, also has not curbed its business with Enron. 
""We have a credit process for our counterparties which tells us how much collateral is required. That could come into play if there were further problems with Enron's credit, but we haven't seen that yet,"" Duke Energy spokesman Terry Francisco said. 
Traders at Reliant Energy, Williams Cos., Dynegy and El Paso Corp all said they continue to deal with Enron but were closely monitoring the situation. 
CREDIT SQUEEZE 
Despite the current calm among energy traders, analysts cautioned Enron's shrinking capitalization could still squeeze its cash supply and hamper its ability to do business. 
Questions about some off-balance sheet deals with two partnerships helped pummel the company's stock this week to its lowest level since 1992, shrinking market capitalization to less than $9 billion from more than $60 billion in January. 
Most of Enron's power and gas deals are in the unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) market, so no one outside of the company knows what trades are on their books. 
But Enron, the biggest market maker in energy products, has consistently preached a balanced or hedged book. 
""Some people may be scaling back their dealings with Enron, but I think you can rely on Enron to do what they should do in risk management practices,"" Ed Krapels, director at Massachusetts-based Energy Security Analysis Inc told Reuters. 
""I think at the end of the day, their book was balanced enough and they should be able to weather the storm."" 
But Krapels cautioned that further deterioration in Enron's share price and credit standing might force the company to post larger cash deposits with its counterparties and ultimately restrict trading operations. 
Earlier today, Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on Enron's stock to ""neutral"" from ""accumulate"". 
Enron's shares ended down $1.91, or 13.7 percent, at $11.99.

INDIA PRESS:Dabhol Creditors Meeting In London Called Off

11/01/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- A meeting among creditors of India's Dabhol Power Co. in London, originally scheduled for Friday and Saturday, has been cancelled, reports the Business Standard. 
According to some domestic lenders, the meeting was canceled because a solution to the Dabhol's problems was in sight, the newspaper reports.
""The government is working out a solution to the problem along with the domestic financial institutions. It only makes sense to meet after the solution is worked out,"" the report quoted a source in the domestic lenders' consortium as saying. 
However, a source in the foreign lenders' consortium said last-minute engagements of leading executives in Industrial Development Bank Of India and ICICI resulted in the cancellation of the meeting. 
Dabhol, a $2.9 billion, 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is a unit of U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE). 
The project ran into trouble after Dabhol's sole buyer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, refused to purchase power from the plant, saying the company's tariffs were ""exorbitant and unaffordable."" Enron has threatened to sell its controlling 65% stake in Dabhol following a long-standing payment dispute with MSEB and India's federal government for its failure to honor a payment guarantee. 
Dabhol is India's largest foreign investment to date. Newspaper Web site: www.business-standard.com

John --

To your point #3Burr --

Probably want to bring in Steve Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is Allison Duncan) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.  Steve Montovano could probably be of assistance here.  Maybe bring in Allison to DC to deal directly with the staff?

Subject:	Hill Meetings on RTOs


I had two interesting meetings yesterday afternoon with staff to key members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee: Rep. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS).  Terry Allen, one of our consultants, accompanied me.

In both meetings, I used to great effect the broad coalition that had filed with us in the Southeast RTO case against the North Carolina PUC stay request.  If you didn't see it -- there is a long article on the coalition and the filing in yesterday's Energy Daily, which I used with the staff to show the many groups that support what we need in the Southeast.  I am going to send them the filing itself as a follow up.

Burr is very important because he is the lead cosponor of the Sawyer-Burr bill that has voluntary RTO language and effectively a prohibition on mandatory RTOs.  Key points--

	1,	We had heard from a friend of Carin's in the Burr office that Burr and/or the staff did not have favorable view of Enron.  I checked with the head of the Duke office -- a personal friend of mine -- who said the staffer has friends who work for Southern.  However, at the meeting, the staffer said that Burr's office had had difficulties with prior Enron lobbyists no longer with the company and that they looked forward to a fresh start.

	2.	Burr's main interest is transmission legislation that provides incentives for more investment so Wall Street will look favorably on transmission.  His main interest is in the incentive pricing section.  He said the bill was put in as they left so could stake out an opening position before Barton releases a draft in September.  (This confirms Pat's observation that Burr likes to be a player.)

	3.	Staff said Burr has done interviews in which he said that a handful of RTOs are inevitable and desirable -- the question is how to get there.  To date, he has been most influenced by the NC PUC -- (Commissioner Ervin, son or grandson of the late Senator, is a family friend of the Burr staffer).  The PUC says that the FERC RTO plans for the SE would force NC to act on retail competition before 2006 -- which it is not in a position to do.  (We need to respond to this argument.)

	4.	Burr staff acknowledged that the final subcommittee-approved bill (if there is one), would move far in the direction of the FERC plan.  He said that the draft to be sent out from committee staff next week will be a staff draft and that it may not even address the tough issues like RTOs -- leaving those decisions to Members.  (I will check with Andy Black -- who told me a few weeks ago that it would either affirm FERC's authority or make RTOs mandatory.)

	5.	Burr would be very interested in meeting with Ken Lay (per the request letter we had faxed earlier yesterday).

Pickering is important for the added reason that he is the primary House sponsor of PUHCA repeal.  His staff confirmed many of the details about process in the House that we had heard elsewhere.  The staff draft will be out next week -- may not cover all issues yet.  There will be 2-3 hearings in September.  That will be followed by a Barton draft that would be formally introduced (reflecting additions and changes from the staff draft.)

	1.	On PUHCA -- I raised our concerns about the recordkeeping provisions and gave him the clarifying language from V&E included in our draft package of language we gave DOE.  He said he has spoken to Kelliher (whose advice he respects) and that Joe said the recordkeeping language needed to be clarified.  Joe referred him to the version in H.R. 2944 in the last Congress (which I will check to see if that solves our problem.)  Staffer is willing to look at our language.

	2.	On RTOs -- Pickering's office has not too much.  The staffer is under the impression that Entergy might actually like them in the way FERC has proposed.  He said Southern has raised concerns about FERC's plans with Pickering's office, but the staffer gets the impression that Southern thinks they are inevitable -- it is all a matter of timing.  The disturbing thing is the staffer said something about perhaps staging the RTO process so there would be more of them of smaller scope now on a pre-set path to 4-5 later.  I said this was a bad idea -- wasted resources to form the interm steps and likely that the final 4-5 would then never happen.  Instead, Congress needs to follow FERC's lead that 4-5 make sense based on natural trading markets, power flows, etc.

I was encouraged by these meetings in terms of not encountering stiff resistance -- but coming away knowing we need to fully implement our aggressive campaign plans to keep the legislative process from becoming a hindrance to achieving our RTO goals."

Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for. We had a good talk. I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.

Best,

Sure.  Confidentially, CSFB has the IPO.  Morgan Stanley is quietly handling 
some select acquisition inquiries.  I mentioned Enron and they didn't see why 
you'd want to look - so I offered to find out.  I think you'd be impressed by 
the CEO.

You can email me or call me at 310.201.4117.  I'm traveling Monday but always 
reachable.  Happy Turkey Day.

El Paso Line #1103

?	The El Paso restart approval has switched from the OPS to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  The NTSB is currently investigating the explosion to determine a cause to the blast.

?	Once cause is established, the project will then shift back to the OPS, when they will begin to analyze the data from tests that El Paso is currently running.  At this point, OPS may request El Paso to either rerun certain tests or perform further repairs.

?	The individual at OPS (in charge of El Paso's South Mainline) indicated that all 3 lines were being investigated and tested.  OPS will begin to analyze the test data one line at a time (ex.  line 1103 will be completely tested, analyzed, and cleared for use before following the same steps for lines 1100 and 1110).  The source indicated that as these lines are being tested/repaired the current pressure on the system will not increase but instead be maintained.

?	We are currently developing sources at the NTSB for the following information:
-	Cause of action (#1103)
-	Timeframe to determine cause of action

Per Mr. Steven Kean, of Enron Corp. please see below ( Appendix C - Order 8=
88=20
""Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission
Dominance).=20

                                                                 APPENDIX C


          Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance

          I.  Examples From Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges

               These are examples of allegations that various public

          utilities have refused to provide comparable service, either

          through refusals to wheel, dilatory tactics that so protracted

          negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling, refusals to provide

          service priority equal to native load, or refusals to provide

          service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own use.

               A.  American Electric Power Service Corp. (AEP)

               In 1993, AEP filed, on behalf of its public utility

          associate companies, an open access tariff that offered only firm

          point-to-point service with very limited flexibility.  It did not

          offer network service, flexible point-to-point service, or non-

          firm service.  Thus, it did not provide customers with the same

          flexibility that AEP itself has.  Nor did it provide a service

          priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load.  The

          Commission set AEP's tariff for hearing and, on rehearing, held

          that in order not to be unduly discriminatory, the tariff had to

          offer comparable service.  American Electric Power Service Corp.,

          64 FERC =0F4 61,279 (1993), reh'g, 67 FERC =0F4 61,168 (1994). =
=20

               At hearing, Raj Rao of Indiana Michigan Power Agency (IMPA)

          (Ex. IMPA-1, Feb 23, 1994) and Kenneth Hegemann of American

          Municipal Power-Ohio, Inc. (AMP-Ohio) (Ex. AMPO-1, Feb 23, 1994),

          both senior management officials, testified concerning AEP's
=0F,






                                        - 2 -


          alleged discriminatory practices. 1/  AMP-Ohio is an

          association of municipalities in Ohio, some of whose members

          depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service.=
=20

          IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana, and many of

          IMPA's loads are captive to the AEP transmission system.  The

          witnesses alleged as follows:=20

                    1.  In anticipation of high peak demands, AEP would

               contract for large blocks of available short-term power,

               withhold sale of short-term power, refuse to transmit third

               party short-term power, and require purchases from AEP at

               the emergency rate (100 mill/kwh) when an emergency might

               not exist.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6.

                    2.  In December 1989, AMP-Ohio negotiated a 20 MW

               purchase of short-term power from Louisville Gas & Electric

               Company (LG&E).  AEP refused to wheel because LG&E had

               earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP.=20

               AEP then bought the power from LG&E and offered to resell it

               to AMP-Ohio.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6-7.

                    3.  In January 1990, AMP-Ohio solicited bids for

               February power purchases from a number of utilities

               including AEP.  AEP was not the winning bid.  AMP-Ohio made

               arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders

               and sought transmission through AEP.  When AMP-Ohio gave AEP
                             =20

          1/   After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the
               proceeding, AMP-Ohio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no
               longer necessary.  This withdrawal does not change the fact
               that the testimony was sworn to under oath.

               power, matched the average price of the winning bids, and

               made the sale itself.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 7.

                    4.  In August 1993, an AMP-Ohio member (Columbus, Ohio)

               was purchasing 10 MW of hourly non-displacement power from

               AEP and, after AEP raised its price to 60 mills/kwh, sought

               another source for the next hour.  Consumers Power Company

               and Detroit Edison Company both offered non-displacement

               power at 40 mills.  AEP refused to transmit, saying it had a

               600 MW unit out and could not resell power from another

               source. 2/  Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to

               buy 10 MW of power from AEP at 100 mills/kwh.  Ex. AMPO-1 at

               7-8.

                    5.  In July 1993, two AMP-Ohio members (Columbus and

               St. Mary's) had been buying hourly non-displacement power

               from AEP when the price rose to 35 mills.  Dayton Power &

               Light Company (DP&L) offered to sell at 23 mills and AEP

               agreed to transmit for one hour.  But for the next hour, AEP

               said it had problems with its system, refused to transmit

               the power, kept the power from DP&L for itself and offered

               to sell power to AMP-Ohio for Columbus and St. Mary's at 100
                             =20

          2/   AEP generally limited its offer of short-term transmission
               to buy/sell transactions; that is, AEP would buy the power
               from the seller and resell it to the purchaser.=20
               Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker (Ex. A-73) at
               27-29.  Often, the terms of the buy/sell transaction
               required transmission dependent utilities (TDUs) to maintain
               reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a
               year.  Id.   =20

               mills.  Columbus increased its local generation, but St.

               Mary's purchased 8 MW at 100 mills.  For the next hour, AMP-

               Ohio arranged with DP&L for another 8 MW, hoping AEP would

               transmit under the 24 hour buy-sell agreement.  AEP did

               transmit this power.  Seven hours later in the day, St.

               Mary's Greenup Hydro project power was available and the 8

               MW from DP&L was no longer needed.  If St. Mary's had been

               receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit,

               St. Mary's could have switched to Greenup power.  But

               because AMP-Ohio had changed to daily service, St. Mary's

               had to pay a demand charge for the entire day, even though

               it used the power only 7 hours and would have paid less

               under the hourly rate.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 8-9.=20

                    6.  In January 1994, AMP-Ohio sought to transfer power

               from one member with generation to other members, which

               required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines.=20

               Toledo Edison said yes, AEP said no.  AMP-Ohio's northern

               members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison.  AMP-

               Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny

               transmission and AEP agreed to transmit.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 9. =

                    7.  IMPA arranged to buy 80 MW of short-term power from

               LG&E and have it wheeled, using buy-sell arrangements,

               through Public Service Company of Indiana (PSI) and AEP to

               serve IMPA's load at Richmond (an IMPA member).  The

               delivered price was $.292 per kW-day plus a 1 mill adder.=20

               At the same time AEP arranged to buy 300 MW from PSI at $.30
=0F,






                                        - 5 -


               per kW day plus out-of-pocket energy costs.  Hence, PSI was

               shipping a total of 380 MW to AEP with 80 MW of that amount

               to be delivered to IMPA's load at Richmond.  Then, on a day

               when IMPA should have received the 80 MW, AEP told IMPA that

               PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to

               buy from AEP at $.63 per kW day plus the cost of energy from

               AEP.  IMPA purchased from AEP under protest.  AEP used its

               control over transmission to intercept the 80 MW at a lower

               price and resell it as short-term power to IMPA.  AEP

               claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that

               day.  But the 80 MW was independent of PSI's other sales to

               AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not

               interrupted it.  IMPA-1 at 7.

                    8.  IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located

               at one member, which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint

               Transmission System owned by IMPA, CINergy and Wabash Valley

               Power Association.  To do so, IMPA needed a metering

               agreement with AEP, to which AEP would not agree.  IMPA-1 at

               6.

                    9.  In January 1994, IMPA had power to sell from its

               turbines when AEP and others needed power.  IMPA offered

               power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power

               without an existing contract.  Moreover, since there was no

               short-term tariff, IMPA could not sell the power to another

               utility.  IMPA-1 at 6. =20

               dilatory tactics that raised the customer's transaction

               costs and effectively denied transmission is the ""sham

               transaction"" provision proposed by AEP.  As filed, AEP's

               tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a

               portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a

               former retail customer of AEP.  See, e.g., Ex. BR&WVP-1 (J.

               Bertram Solomon testimony, February 23, 1994).  (As part of

               a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew

               this provision.)=20

                    11.  Finally, AEP's originally filed tariff contained a

               ""prodigal customer"" provision.  Under this provision,

               transmission customers who sought to convert back to

               requirements service had to give AEP five years' notice, in

               which case AEP and the customer would enter into

               negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service

               at all and if so under what rate, terms, and conditions.=20

               Ex. S-39 at 1 (Staff testimony).  AEP did not require notice

               from all new customers, only from prodigal customers.  Id.

               at 2.  That a potential customer was previously served by

               AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently.  (AEP

               withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff.)

                    B.  Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy)=20

               Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR

          pro forma tariffs except for two provisions (headroom and

          ancillary services).  Because the settlement predated the filing

          date for customer testimony before the ALJ, the customers did not

                                        - 7 -


          address the need for Entergy to file a tariff.  However,

          customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices, as

          follows.    =20

                    1.  Customers alleged that Entergy flat-out refused to

               wheel.  Louisiana Energy and Power Authority (LEPA) witness

               Sylvan J. Richard testified that LEPA's predecessor systems

               could not obtain interconnections from Entergy.  Ex. SJR-1

               at 50.

                    2.  Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to

               provide service priority equal to native load and refused to

               provide service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own

               use.  For example, LEPA witness Richard testified that even

               after state commissions ordered interconnections and other

               coordination services, LEPA's predecessors were still not

               able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not

               willing to coordinate and because the transmission service

               it did offer was inflexible, unidirectional point-to-point

               service, which prevented economic coordination with others.=

                    3.  South Mississippi Electric Power Association

               (SMEPA) witness J. Bertram Solomon testified that Entergy's

               original ""open access"" tariff was restricted to point-to-

               point service, proposed separate charges for each operating

               company, and required the cancellation of existing

               agreements in order to take service under the proposed

               tariff.  Ex. SMEPA-10 at 28.  Entergy eventually filed a
=0F,






                                        - 8 -


               network tariff, but proposed different local facilities

               charges for the various Entergy public utility operating

               subsidiaries.  Id. at 29.  Since these local facilities

               charges were higher than the transmission component of the

               subsidiaries' bundled rates, Entergy obtained a competitive

               advantage.  Id.

                    4.  The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives (ACC) is a

               group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate

               electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas.=20

               ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has

               segregated the wholesale market between two of its

               subsidiaries, Arkansas Power & Light Copmpany (APL) and

               Entergy Power, Inc. (EPI).  Ex. SMM-1 at 16.  In marketing

               power and energy in Arkansas, EPI is subject to an Arkansas

               Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for

               wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver.  Id.=20

               Recently, EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale

               transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers

               currently served by an Entergy subsidiary; in other words,

               EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition

               for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete

               with APL.  Id.  ACC witness Merchant concluded that, since

               EPI does not compete with APL, Entergy insulates APL's

               wholesale business from competition and denies those

               wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power,

               thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to

               ACC.  Id. at 17-19.  (Entergy's witness Kenney stated that

               Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the

               Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit

               EPI to sell to APL's wholesale customers.  Ex. JFK-11 at 14-

               15.)

               C.  Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E)

               Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) attached several

          documents to its 1988 complaint in Docket No. EL89-4.  These

          documents were provided to support NCPA's claim that PG&E's

          unreasonable practices under the PG&E/NCPA Interconnection

          Agreement (IA) effectively denied NCPA access to transmission

          properly requested under the IA.  Although the parties eventually

          settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter

          order dated May 18, 1988, these documents provide allegations of

          PG&E using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to

          effectively equal a refusal to wheel. 3/      =20

                    1.  PG&E stated that since transmission was not

               currently available, it was entitled to wait 72 months

               before providing transmission; that is, transmission access

               could not be granted before the passing of the 72-month

               notice period.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 3.  However, the IA
                             =20

          3/   All of these incidents are related to and examples of PG&E's
               conduct described in the NOPR (FERC Stats. & Regs. =0F4 32,5=
14
               at 33,073 n.151), that is, the history of PG&E's attempt to
               avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the
               California Oregon Transmission Project (COTP).  However,
               these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents
               described in the NOPR, because NCPA is not one of the owners
               of the COTP.

               provided that transmission be provided when it becomes

               actually available.  PG&E also requested substantial

               additional information, which NCPA considered beyond that

               reasonably necessary for a study, but still provided.  PG&E

               then determined that transmission was not available,

               reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the

               transmission requested could be provided 8760 hours per year

               without restrictions or limitations, extending through the

               expiration of the agreement in 2013.  NCPA 1988 Complaint at

                    2.  On November 27, 1987, NCPA made a new transmission

               request to PG&E, seeking 50 MW of bi-directional

               transmission at Midway.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 5.  On

               January 28, 1988, PG&E filed an interconnection agreement

          Mr. Bigelow described both NU's and NEP's (his own company)

          failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own

          use.  Except for NEP's TDUs, both NEP and NU historically

          provided only point-to-point transmission, which required

          separate scheduling for each transaction.  Bigelow Cross Rebuttal

               22-23.=20

                    2.  Edison would not generally provide transmission

               service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing

               the economy energy that would be wheeled.  McCann testimony

               at 19.  The Cities called Edison every hour to request

               interruptible transmission service.  Id..  Edison often

               refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems

               Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost

               contract energy or partial requirements service.  Id. at 19-

               20. =20

                    3.  When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm

               transmission of power from neighboring states, Edison would

               often agree to provide non-firm service but would not

               integrate the capacity for many years in the future, saying

               that its control area did not need capacity at that time.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 9.  Since the selling utility was

               interested in a sale of capacity, not just energy, the

               transaction would not occur.  Id.  Edison repeatedly used

               its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low-

               cost firm power.  Id. at 9-10. =20

                    4.  While Edison provided short-term firm transmission

               service to the Cities, it would only provide long-term firm

               service for three specific resources:  the SONGS nuclear

               plant, a specific IPP, and Hoover Dam power.  Hoyt testimony

               at 20.  One of Edison's reasons for denying long-term

               transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the

               transmission for its own future (unspecified) needs.  Id. =
=20

                    5.  In the 1970s, Edison refused to allow the Cities

               access to the Pacific Intertie.  Hoyt testimony at 21; Drews

               testimony at 7-8. =20

                    6.  In 1988, Edison refused to provide transmission

               service for a Cities power purchase from Public Service

               Carnahan testimony at 15. =20

                    8.  Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde

               and was told that such service was not available.  Carnahan

               testimony at 16.  Edison offered Riverside only 12 MW of

               curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riverside's

               share of Palo Verde.  Id.  This service was neither large

                    enough or long enough, and Edison insisted on

                    unreasonable terms and conditions.  Id.

                    9.  Azusa, Banning and Colton had a contract with

               Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm

               transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract

               energy obligation.  Edison refused to permit the three

               cities to use that path.  Edison did not contest that the

               contracts allowed this use, but said that the scheduling of

               such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be

               too burdensome.  Greenwalt testimony at 14.=20

                    10.  Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the

               Cities' requests, routinely taking months to respond.  Drews

               testimony at 15.

                    11.  During the 1980s, Edison provided Colton with some

               transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain

               suppliers, but limited the choices available to the Cities

               and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities'

               costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison.=20

               Drews testimony at 9.  Arranging alternative generation

               sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first

               get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission.=
=20

                    12.  During 1988 and 1989, a dispute arose between

               Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating

               Project.  Drews testimony at 16.  Edison argued that for the

               months when units were out of service for uprating, and

               Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero, Southern

               Cities would not receive an energy credit, even though

               energy was still available and used by Edison.  But the

               contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to

               still schedule its energy as non-firm energy on the capacity

               of another participant.  Id. at 16-17.

                    13.  In 1986, Azusa negotiated a power purchase

               contract with the California Department of Water Resources

               in increments of first 5 MW and then 2 MW (for a total of 7

               MW).  Hsu testimony at 14.  First Edison assured Azusa that

               the transmission for the additional 2 MW would not be a

               problem.  Id.  Then Edison would not agree to amend the

               transmission service agreement for the additional 2 MW.  Id.
=0F,






                                        - 16 -


                    14.  In 1986, Azusa notified Edison of Special

               Condition 12 4/ purchases from PG&E and requested firm

               transmission service.  Id.  Two months before service was to

               begin, Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the

               transmission lines.  Id.  Transmission was eventually

               granted, but only after a four-month delay and substantial

               losses to the Cities.  Id.  Then Edison decided there was no

               problem with its transmission facilities.  Id. at 14-15.

                    15.  In 1986-87, the Cities purchased 20 MW from PG&E

               and 80 MW from Deseret G&T Cooperative.  Hoyt testimony at

               7-8.  Edison stated that without reinforcement of its

               transmission system, Edison would not provide the

               transmission.  Id.  There was a five-month delay during

               which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a

               higher cost.  Id. at 8-9.  Then Edison decided that the

               transmission system did not need reinforcement.  Id. at 8.

                    16.  Edison also refused to provide a service priority

               equal to that of native load.  It would curtail the Cities

               in order to purchase more economy energy for itself.  McCann

               testimony at 28.  If Edison could make the purchase, it

               would curtail the City and use the energy for itself.  Id.=

               When Edison curtailed the Cities, they were not able to

          4/   Special Condition 12 of the Integrated Operations Agreement
               between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain
               Special Condition 12 resources and allowed the Cities to
               make certain uses of those resources, subject to certain
               restrictions.=20
=0F,

               purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from

               Edison.  Id. at 24.

                    17.  According to Edison, the interruptible

               transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for

               any reason.  Id. at 20.  A purchase could be terminated the

               hour after it is begun or even during the hour.  Id.  As a

               result, the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous

               economy purchases.  Id. at 20-21. =20

                    18.  Edison also refused to provide customers

               flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided

               itself.  Edison's refusal to provide bi-directional

               transmission service restricted the Cities' abilities to

               purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 22.  Because most contracts with Northwest

               utilities require a return of power, the Northwest utilities

               would not deal with the Cities without transmission to

               return energy.  Id. at 22-23.  Edison did provide bi-

               directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of

               Water & Power (LADWP) to accommodate flows to and from

               Arizona.  Id.

                    19.  Riverside was unable to obtain non-firm service

               more than two hours in advance of need.  Carnahan testimony

               at 18.

                    20.  Riverside and Colton were both served out of

               Edison's Vista substation.  Although the two cities were on

               the same 69 kV bus, Edison would not allow them to sell

               energy to each other.  Greenwalt testimony at 17.=20

                    21.  Riverside's agreement with Edison allowed

               Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and

               divide it up among the four Cities (Azusa, Banning, Colton

               and Riverside).  Greenwalt testimony at 17.  When Riverside

               had excess energy from other sources, Edison would not

               permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities.=20

               Id.  For example, Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy

               transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system.  Id. at 17-18.=20

               LADWP would not break out the Cities' shares of that energy,

               and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all

               four cities.  Id. at 18.  Edison argued that because this

               energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use,

               Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into

               the control area.  Id.  As a result, Riverside paid for the

               energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area, but

               could not sell it to the other three cities, and gave it to

               Edison itself, which consumed the energy without making any

               payment for it.  Id.  Riverside tried a number of

               alternative paths, including using WSPP transmission where

               Riverside paid Edison 5 mills to connect to Azusa, 5 mills

               to connect to Banning, and 5 mills to connect to Colton for

               each megawatthour.  While this approach was successful for a

               while, eventually Edison refused to permit these sales. =20

                    22.  Edison claimed that the Cities only have

               transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition 12
=0F,






                                        - 19 -


               energy to satisfy the Cities' load.  Greenwalt testimony at

               18. =20

                    23.  Edison contended that the Cities' load

               requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources

               and then by Special Condition 12 and economy energy

               purchases.  Id. at 19.  When the Cities' integrated

               resources exceeded their load, any Special Condition 12

               resources became excess.  Under Riverside's Deseret

               contract, the Cities were required to take a minimum of 35

               MW each hour.  Id.  Edison acknowledged that it was

               obligated to buy, or allow the Cities to sell, any excess

               energy from Riverside's integrated resources.  Id.  However,

               Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special

               Condition 12 energy brought into the area, claiming that the

               Cities could not have brought it in because they did not

               have transmission rights.  Id. =20

          II.  Other Examples of Transmission Disputes

               Disputes over transmission are not uncommon, contrary to

          EEI's suggestion.  Some recent examples taken from pleadings and

          other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has

          been very difficult for various entities in the electric power

          industry to agree on transmission rights.  These examples also

          reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR

          with its proposed pro forma tariffs, there has been considerable

          controversy over whether various utilities' ""open access"" tariffs

          deviate from those tariffs.  (The Commission has allowed
=0F,






                                        - 20 -


          utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the non-rate

          terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain

          certain benefits.)

                    A.  In a letter of February 3, 1995 to Mr. Gerald

               Richman of the Commission's Enforcement section in the

               Office of the General Counsel, Steven J. Kean, Vice

               President, Regulatory Affairs, Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

               (Enron) alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NiMo)

               refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E)

               to Enron under RG&E's transmission contract with NiMo;

               however, when Enron revealed the buyer, NiMo did wheel power

               for RG&E to the buyer.  Mr. Kean alleged that this was not

               an isolated incident.  NiMo argued that the contract did not

               require it to provide RG&E with transmission to Enron.  It

               also said that the principle of comparability does not

               require the service.  Letter of November 21, 1994 from NiMo

               representative A. Karen Hill to Gerald Richman.

                    B.  The Commission's Task Force Hot Line (Hot

               Line) received a complaint that a member of the New

               York Power Pool (NYPP) refused to transmit power that

               another member bought from a power marketer.  In a

               letter of November 17, 1994, from Chair Moler to Mr.

               William J. Balet, Executive Director of NYPP, Chair

               Moler explained that the Commission's enforcement staff

               had investigated and found the allegation to be true.

                    C.  In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency

               v. Northern States Power Company (Minnesota), 73 FERC =0F4

               61,350 (1995), NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which

               NSP agreed to provide transmission service.  However,

               the parties had numerous disputes over the service.=20

               The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the

               contract in several ways.  For, example, SMMPA argued

               that it should be able to directly schedule its

               deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and

               that it should not be limited to particular points of

               delivery.  NSP argued that only it was entitled to

               control the physical operation of scheduling.  The

               Commission found that the clear language of the

               contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own

               power. =20

                    D.  Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, 72 FERC =0F4 61,223

               (1995), involved MAPP's membership criteria, which made it

               impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the

               benefits of certain transmission services available only to

               MAPP members.  The Commission found that the membership

               criteria may be unreasonable, particularly since there may

               be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria

               for non-traditional entities.

   It's a Party and You're Invited


   Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
  Day:  Sunday, September 10
  Time:  4:00 p.m.
  Place:  Woods on Augusta (pool area)

 I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

 Please bring your own ""Cheer"".

 Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

This sounds good dude, but you should push her a touch to see if there's any
interest.  Reply an hour after you get one - see what happens.  I'm
certainly not saying don't lose your mind like I've clearly done.  Aren't

Vince,

Margaret mentioned to me that you might be able to help me with the 
followings:

We (Central European Origination, London office) might start talking to two 
aluminium companies in Central Europe.  Before we were to meet them, it would 
be rather useful (I suppose) to find out what aluminium deals (if any) you 
closed in the States.  The most important issue would be whether you managed 
to index the price of power to the price of aluminium; if yes, how.

Your help would be much appreacited.

Many thanks,

Jozsef"

Dan

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words ""OR
THE BILL OF SALE"" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee

Can someone in your shop get us copies of the guaranties?  I pulled the one in our ISDA file and the amounts don't match, so I don't know if there have been any amendments or not.

If you can't find someone to pull these, let me know and I'll come down and get them.

Also, Livelink doesn't show a power master with Coral Power LLC, but I have someone checking on this.

		 Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01

Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, ""Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From 
The Most Threatened To Best Positioned"", we got some direct feedback on the 
perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh 
CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel, 
CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the 
moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each 
participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was 
followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael 
Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had ""sold material 
to Enron"" and that ""Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for 
many countries represents currency.""  Michael was clearly proud of his 
transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity.
The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following 
question to the panelists. ""What about Enron? With their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a ""spot"" basis. Will this business model work? Do 
they offer any real value or not?"" 
Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: ""The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments.""
Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: ""Enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a ""break even"" business to support their financial instruments. At 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd).""
Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: ""I addressed the Enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the 
previous evening). I am calling Enron the ""Hunts of the steel business"" with 
their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese. 
You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone. 
Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without 
immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and I believe they will be gone within the year.""(some sporadic applause)   
Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: ""Right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market.""
It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a ""spot"" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

Hi Steve,

Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on 
Enron's videos.

You asked me whether or not our new ""Pro-Sumer"" field production equipment 
can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has 
a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file 
storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download 
moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, 
you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know 
that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the 
technology and let you know when it has been developed.

I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet 
talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon.

I forgot to mention one thing to you about the ""creative piggybacking"" 
money-saving idea:  using a contractor to coordinate/piggyback video shoots 
is exactly what Microsoft does.  When we interviewed Steve Ballmer in 
January, we went to Microsoft's facilities and used Microsoft's crew.  Then 
they invoiced us for a whopping $1800.00 (for fewer than 15 minutes of 
shooting time).  

Steve, I hope that as your thoughts progress about Enron's video needs, 
you'll consider me to be part of the team.  I would like to help develop and 
be a part of the solutions.

Liz,

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
Mark Taylor, as well.

Vince

Tana,  Stephanie and I just confirmed that I still do not have full access to 
lotus notes.  I cannot, for example, edit any legal notes re: our 
brokerage/trading agreements.  Stephanie suggested that I ask you for 
guidance.


Stephanie, as per our discussion, in the meantime can you put the following 
updates in Lotus notes:

ITG POSIT:   Cheryl sent document for execution on 2/8.  Sheila Glover 
suggested changes to pricing schedule.  2/9 Cheryl called counsel regarding 
need to edit.

WSI:  2/9 Cheryl talked to John Bosse and recommended some material changes.  
Bosse is sending a forecast agreeemtn today so that some terms therein can be 
implemented into a final draft.  Will call on Monday to follow up.

Bear Sterns InterConnect:  2/9 Cheryl sent an email message to Christine 
Durlin and she responded.  We are in the process of discussing problematic 
issues re: arbitration and indemnification.  Bear Sterns apologized for the 
delay -- they admitted to losing the paperwork and changing personnel who 
were handling the agreement.  Cheryl and Christine plan to look into the 
issues and talk Monday or Tuesday.

Robertson Stephens:   2/9 Cheryl called Alberto Delgadillo again asking for 
the status on their legal review.  
2/5: Samantha called -- they said they never got the comments that our 
outside counsel sent on 1/5 so Samantha resent. 

JP Morgan: 2/9 & 2/1 Cheryl left message for status of their review of our 
comments.

Tana,

Per my message to you on Friday, Frank and I are planning on working through 
this tomorrow.  It may be a good idea if you can join us as you are familiar 
with this type of request.  In addition, the transactions they provided in 
the Exhibit do not have transaction numbers, I am going to need these 
transaction numbers to understand the exposure.  If they can not provide the 
transaction numbers, then is it possible for the Confirm group to provide the 
active transactions we have with Fletcher so I can cross reference them with 
the exposure we show in our credit system, and tie them back to the 
transaction detail they have provided.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: Assignment of Fletcher Challenge Swaps; Response to inquiry letter

Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.  
Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather 
quickly.  Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to 
proceed on this assignment.  Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe 
give Bert a call, or what...?  Please let us know.

Tana:

This email is just a follow-up on the telephone message that I left for you 
earlier today.  As I explained, our firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) represents 
Apache Corporation and I will be replacing Saul Laureles in concluding our 
work related to the assignment of certain natural gas price swaps from 
Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited (""Fletcher Challenge"") to Shell 
Overseas Holdings Limited (""Shell""), and the reassignment from Shell to 
Apache Corporation. My contact information is as follows:

Robert J. Viguet, Jr. (""Bert"")
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White Williams & Martin
1200 Smith Street, Suite 1400
Houston, Texas 77056
Telephone:  713-654-9693
FAX:   713-658-2553
rviguet@chamberlainlaw.com

You should have received a letter from Saul Laureles dated February 6, 2001 
via overnight courier requesting that your firm confirm certain facts related 
to the swaps to be assigned as described above.  We are looking for a written 
response to that inquiry at your earliest opportunity.  If there are any 
errors or other discrepancies in the list of swap transactions or other 
matters identified in the letter, we need to know as soon as possible so that 
there will be time to resolve those issues before the assignments are made.

This firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) has prepared a draft of the Assignment and 
Assumption Agreements for the transfer of the swaps from Fletcher Challenge 
to Shell and from Shell to Apache Corporation. Our draft of the assignment 
forms is being reviewed by attorneys for Shell now, but should be available 
for your review in a few days. The acquisition of assets of Fletcher 
Challenge Energy by Shell and Apache, and the related assignments of the swap 
transactions, is expected to closes in early March.

If you have any questions or comments concerning the proposed transactions, 
please don't hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to ""hedge"" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
""unworkably competitive"" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed ""quickly""?

Please add other questions.

		 Subject: Governor  Davis' Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today wi th 
Financial Analysts: Summary


> Governor  Davis' Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today with
> Financial Analysts: Summary
> 
> The host of the teleconference was Mr. Joseph Fichera, CEO of Saber
> Partners (serving as Governor's independent Bond Counsel)
> 
> Mr. Fichera's goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the
> Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to
> market sometime in June.  Fichera told me yesterday that he does these
> calls on an ""as needed"" basis.  There appeared to be some concern that the
> ""media is getting ahead of the story"" and the inference could be made that
> this is causing problems for the Governor's MOU legislation (which they
> also said they hope to have signed by June) and perhaps for the emerging
> ""Plan B"" as well.  
> 
> A replay of this teleconference is available at www.energyinfo.ca.gov.ca
> 
> Mr. Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections:
> 
> California State Senate: Pieces of Governor's MOU legislation moving in
> separate committees; in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward.
> 
> Assembly Plan B Group: Assemblymembers Keeley, Dutra and Nation are
> working together and have good ideas to move the Governor's MOU
> legislation through.  Fichera said that the Governor's office is meeting
> with both parties but the plan is still in the  formative stages.  He
> added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the
> proposal is imminent.  They are hopeful that it will be ""moving toward
> resolution in a week or two.""
> 
> Generators: Fichera stated that since the Governor's meeting with the
> generators, a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governor's
> staff and advisors to resolve the issues.  He stated that the issue of
> litigation and investigations by the AG's office is ""off the table"" for
> discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and
> managing the coming summer.
> 
> QFs: Governor's team has facilitated 5 days of discussions with SCE and
> QFs over past two weeks; most QFs are represented at these negotiations.
> They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going
> forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market.  Their hope is
> that due to negotiations, the QFS will all be fully available to the
> market this summer.
> 
> PGE:  They see the bankruptcy judge's refusal to allow certain QFs to get
> out of their contracts as a positive development. 
> 
> QFs on-line: There are currently 700 MWs off-line; this is better than
> their model anticipated for May.  They expect more than 90%
> on-line by June.  Last month 1700 QF MWs off-line; Fichera explained that
> standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June 1 during
> peaks but that they are allowed to be off during off-peak hours.  He added
> that they are still trying to resolve their issues.
> 
> Key aspects of budget plan (by this I believe he meant energy financing,
> not the annual budget):  conservation and contracts
> 
> Conservation: They built in a 4% reduction in demand and 3% reduction for
> price elasticity--conservatively projecting  7% in conservation.  He
> stated the we saw 9% conservation in March and April, ""so we think our
> model is conservative.""  Fichera added that the new electricity rates go
> out in June and they expect that this will cause a ""good reaction"" due to
> price signals and demand reduction.
> 
> They also built in 2% in natural load growth to their projections as well
> to further ensure a conservative estimate.
> 
> Energy Costs: Projected ($1.78 billion) vs. actual ($1.80 billion) equals
> a variance of 1.4%
> 
> May Energy Costs:  As of May 6th, right on budget target, with a variance
> of less than a half percent
> 
> Contracts:  Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and
> reduce the net short exposure in the spot market.  He added that 10-20% of
> necessary contracts are not yet executed, but rather in the agreement in
> principal stage.  He released the following stats:
> 
> Needed executed contracts completed (these percentages must refer to
> projected load accounted for): 43% for May, 67% for June, 48% for July,
> 42% for August
> 
> When agreements in principle added in: 73% for June, 67% for July, 60% for
> August:
> 
> Questions from analysts:
> 
> Have you built-in an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of
> contracts?  ""No, we do not because we are fighting the opt-out positions.
> The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to
> be involved to stop that.  A few hundred MWs have gone into the market.
> We are aware of this issue, which is why we're pushing the MOUs--this
> litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back
> payment issue would be settled.""
> 
> Timing with SDG&E,  where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle?  We
> have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations   due to other decisions
> {happening simultaneously around us].  We are resuming face to face
> negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement.
> There is no drop dead date.
> 
> Generators working group? We're discussing DWR credit issues, summer,
> support for MOU--the generators have issues with outstanding payments due.
> The Governor expects them to provide haircut re: those payments and that's
> part of discussion.
> 
> QF resolution: will gas QFs be released from contracts?  We don't know
> what PG&E is going to do but they could do that-- release at any time--no
> indications yet--haven't affirmed all the contracts yet.  We want to avoid
> this in the SCE situation.  There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply
> both utilities.  We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking
> for.
> 
> Bond issue timing? The current plan, assuming there is no further action
> by the legislature, is to close sales 91 days after bond sales, on Aug.
> 14.  We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period.  We are
> making a bridge loan from the General Fund.  In June we see improved
> revenue stream from ISO; rate increases will also improve cash stream.
> 
> Can you give us any prices on new contracts?  Not on new contracts, we are
> resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual
> contracts.  Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed
> so far.
> 
> Where is the legislature?  Legislators want to see sharing of the pain--so
> far the focus has been mostly on generators.  The undercollection is
> associated so far with the generators, legislators are beginning to see
> that only about 1/3 of the undercollection is tied to generators.  So
> should QFs and commercial banks share the pain?  Some think some are less
> guilty than others.  We can only deal with Edison.  The media has gotten a
> little ahead of the process, this is going to take longer than a few
> weeks.  
> 
> Handicap?  Lead horse?  The Assembly is more organized and focused right
> now on enhancements and changes to the Governor's  plan; the Senate is not
> as organized, though we have engaged with Senator Burton--we met with him
> 3 times this week.  And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to
> implement the Governor's plan.
> 
> If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from
> contracts--how does this affect your financial plans?  ""I think it would
> change it dramatically.  It would be a budget busting event.""  That's why
> we're resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature
> sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution.
> 
> Does this need to be solved before bond issue?  The combination of AB1x
> and 31x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to
> recover all costs.  We think that only a few QFs can survive without
> long-term contracts, so it's also possible that not all would go into spot
> market, few may be able to survive as merchant generators.  
> 
> Windfall profits tax--helpfulness of generators--did they perform
> adequately during summer of 2000?  What are your expectations of their
> performance?  The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mind--he
> left that open as to how he'll evaluate their performance. People at DWR
> and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this
> matter.
> 
> Bond issue timing?  We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell
> bonds by end of June ""if stars are aligned""--it may be one mega-deal or
> several tronches (sp?)--this is still open for discussion.  Even with the
> rising prices that we expect this summer, most of our net short will be
> under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we don't
> expect our budget to be busted.
> 
> Extended bridge financing commitment?--irrelevant because we don't have
> authority to issue for 90 days.
> 
> Renewable QFs/gas prices--is there anything can you do--levelize gas
> prices so they can operate under ""S-rack"" (sp?) price formula?
> 
> Many options have been discussed, to bring them into the market we need
> such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be
> worked out.
> 
> Polanco MOU legislation: is it identical to the Governor's view or already
> changed?  This is the implementing legislation for the Governor's MOU--not
> changed so far.  Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that
> could be changed. (He went on to explain that anything taken out must be
> replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced...) This is going
> to take some time; however, we do have a sense of urgency--we are hoping
> for a vote sometime in June.  The MOU has deadline of August 15.

Attached please find a revised First Amendment Agreement which amends Section 
2 of the Flow of Funds memo to add a provision directing ECS to pay to ENA 
the extra $30,488 it was wired by ECHO, and adding a clause to Section 
3(a)(ii) to reflect that ECS is to use such extra wired amount to satisfy 
such obligation.   We trust this accommodates both ECS and ECHO, and hope to 
move forward with execution tomorrow (Wednesday 6/28).  Please contact us as 
soon as possible with any further comments and to coordinate execution.  
Regards, NJD

Subject: Outstanding Invoices


Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Chris Garrod

We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated
collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The
agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your
advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we
would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call
either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can
send me an e-mail if that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the
cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any
additional information, please contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable
from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston time.

Richard
I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement. TVA has agreed to these 
changes.
TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
we did not think they met our agreements.
My  comments to are as follows:
I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
submitted. We support this wording.
In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence.
Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one.
Thanks

I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each 
other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps 
growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches.  
Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at 
night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not 
getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes 
it alot easier for me since we can trade off.

Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just 
to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going 
to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very 
much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in 
his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are 
hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected.  
He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel 
very, very fortunate.

How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with 
everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that 
you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think 
about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just 
beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair

Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home 
with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him 
while he is in school.

I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are 
your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up 
for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope 
to see you soon.  Take care.

Greetings, Sandra.  I hope life will be treating you better over there
soon.  As you might know, most of EnergyUSA was given pink slips effective
over the next 3-6 months.  As a result, it is back looking for another job.
I was wondering if it would be possible for you to write a letter of
recommendation for me?   I'm really regretting this leave from Enron now.
In my quest for looking for something stable, I ended up fucking myself up.
At least I have a few months before our house is finished.  Hopefully, I'll
have something by then.

Thanks,

Jeff the Genius"

Subject: Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to 
follow):

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and 
Sam know then Sam can get them set us.

Thanks for your help!

Tana/Mark,
Columbia Gulf has requested the following changes to their NDA. The legal entity name should read ""Columbia Gulf Transmission Company.""  They would also like to add point number 9 which states, "" The execution of this agreement relative to confidential information does not obligate either party to enter into any other agreement or any transaction as that term is referenced herein.""

As long as you don't have any issues with the changes, please forward a copy to Jim Hart at Columbia.  They are scheduled to come over for a demo next week.

Michelle,

The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker,
5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.

I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level
of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable
time.

Dan,

Attached below is another Netting Agreement that this counteparty would like 
to have executed.  This is mainly an active Canadian counterparty (where we 
have all contracts executed with ECC) but they also do business with ENA.  
The exposures are getting significant enough where they are needing netting 
arrangements.  

Please take a look at this draft that they have forwarded below.  If you find 
it unacceptable, let me know and I will communicate it to the counterparty 
and forward ours.  They initiated this and preferred we view their ""simple"" 
document.

Thanks,

Veronica

Stan,

I have one minor question.  

Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following 
y event? 

I would expect to see language along the lines of ""If notice to proceed is 
not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then..."".  I see the 
deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this 
EPC different terminology is used.

Kay

Creditors Chafe at State's Pace on Power Crisis 


By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers


     The California energy crisis is hurtling along two tracks--one the slow 
lane of legislative politics, the other the hyper-speed autobahn of high 
finance. 

     As Stage 3 electricity alerts and billion-dollar debts mount, some 
travelers on those intersecting byways are strapping themselves in for what 
they see as a looming pileup, perhaps at the doors of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court. 

     Wall Street is becoming increasingly irritated with the deliberative 
pace of the California Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis and his months of 
unfulfilled vows of a remedy. 

     Those owed money by Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric said Wednesday that they cannot not wait forever to be paid. 

     ""The pace of progress is not sufficient,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, 
president of Reliant Energy, a major power supplier in the state. ""Our 
accounts receivable from the past aren't being taken care of and the bleeding 
is growing."" 

     In Sacramento, no immediate first aid is on the way. 
     Davis, who says he will announce his latest plan to solve the utilities' 
financial meltdown on Friday, left little doubt on Wednesday that he intends 
to press for a state takeover of the massive electricity transmission system, 
despite its huge value to the utilities. But key legislators predict that, no 
matter what the governor proposes, they are at least two weeks away from 
passing legislation to improve the situation. 

     Bob Foster, the Edison official who oversees governmental affairs, said 
the question of bankruptcy is ""a day-to-day thing. There are signs that 
creditors are getting increasingly nervous, increasingly impatient."" 

     ""We were told last week that there will be a proposal from the 
administration, and we're still waiting,"" Foster said. 

     Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said that if 
Davis and lawmakers cannot resolve the matter within the next two weeks, ""we 
aren't going to be able to solve it, and it will be in other people's hands."" 

     Edison and PG&E have said they do not want to file for bankruptcy 
protection and will do so only if forced by their creditors. A prelude to 
bankruptcy, the formation of creditors committees, already has begun. Each 
utility can be forced into bankruptcy by as few as three creditors owed as 
little as $10,775 in unsecured debts, bankruptcy experts say. 

     ""We respectfully believe that the state has less time than they might 
otherwise think,"" Gary Dunton, president and chief executive officer of MBIA 
Inc., a firm that insures $1.3 billion of the utilities' debt. 

     ""If someone called me an hour from now [to announce a bankruptcy 
filing],"" Dunton added, ""I wouldn't be surprised. We have been very clear 
that we are frustrated with the timing, and apparent lack of urgency. 

     ""If you have 100 people cooking a stew, it may never be edible."" 
     Not everyone, however, believes that the prolonged legislative process 
will make much difference in the long run, despite the howls from creditors' 
and utilities. 

     ""I don't sense that there is a sense of urgency,"" said Assemblyman 
George Runner Jr. (R-Lancaster). Runner, like other legislators, pointed to 
repeated deadlines that have come and gone without a bankruptcy, and said: 
""Crying wolf can go so far."" 

     Some legislators blame Davis for the delays. 

     ""The Legislature will pass enabling legislation. But people are waiting 
to hear from [the governor's] corner office,"" said Assembly Republican leader 
Bill Campbell of Villa Park, who has not conferred with Davis for a week. ""We 
think it is serious. But it is a frustrating situation."" 

     Some lawmakers in Sacramento believe that not all the legislative gears 
are in sync, thus complicating progress. They say Davis has positioned 
himself politically so that the Legislature will carry the brunt of the blame 
when potential rate increases come into effect. 

     ""The governor is out there saying no more rate increases and that he's 
on the side of consumers, while we have to do the dirty work,"" fumed an 
Assembly Democrat, who requested anonymity out of fear that his comments 
would only inflame an already tense relationship between the executive and 
the Legislature. 

     That irritation grew among Assembly Democrats when a poll they recently 
commissioned showed the Legislature's approval rating had dropped 25 points, 
while Davis' rating remained relatively high. The poll, conducted in late 
January by the Sacramento firm Moore Methods, showed Davis with a 45% 
approval rating, compared with only 25% for the Legislature. 

     Meanwhile, the cost to the state treasury of buying power is rocketing 
toward $2 billion, as the Department of Water Resources buys electricity 
because utilities are no longer able to borrow money. 

     ""Giving [away] $2 billion that could have gone to build schools, 
housing, highways and help lower taxes for consumers . . . is a moral 
outrage,"" said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 

     In the meantime, the electricity bills--and defaults by the two 
utilities--continue to swell with no end in sight. 

     California's power plant owners, already frustrated by the hundreds of 
millions of dollars they haven't been paid by the state's two biggest 
utilities, fear that the debt is growing by millions of dollars a day--even 
after the state ponied up taxpayers money to buy electricity for the 
utilities. That's because power purchasers for the state are refusing to pay 
for all of the electricity that grid operators order on a last-minute basis 
to prevent blackouts. 

     Growing anxious over the slow pace of progress in Sacramento, generators 
are looking for help from the courts and from state and federal regulators. 
They won a victory Wednesday when federal regulators ruled that power 
suppliers cannot be forced to bear the risk that they won't get paid when 
grid operators order them to supply emergency power. 

     Davis said Wednesday that the ongoing snags in buying power are being 
worked out. The lingering problem of the utilities' estimated $12.7 billion 
in electricity debts, Davis said, can be fixed by the state's purchase of the 
transmission grid. The money paid to the utilities for the grid--which would 
have to be negotiated--plus lease payments the state would make to the 
utilities to continue operating the 32,000 miles of high-voltage wires, would 
infuse the companies with enough cash to restructure their debt. 

     ""We're talking about a financial transaction that has value to both 
sides,"" Davis said. ""It has become increasingly clear to me that we cannot 
accomplish that without purchasing the transmission lines."" 

     Although Davis voiced his support of taking over the utilities' 
moneymaking transmission system, he has not conferred with companies' 
executives for a week. In fact, they learned of it from press accounts. 

     ""It's all just a giant game of chicken,"" a top utility executive said, 
asking that he not be identified. ""But I'm worried that the administration is 
going to overplay its hand and leave us with no options.""

Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for 
the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as 
that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly 
to have ""volumetric"" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate 
schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary 
in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  ""on a daily basis  
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".  
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more 
issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.

Lorraine, 
I have your revised letter.? There is only one thing that seems subject to 
possible questions about the intent.? Paragraph 3, last sentence.? I suggest 
it be revised as follows: 

"".....and Transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric 
basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized."" 

This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.? As written 
now, someone could infer that ALL volumes go to max rates whenever ANY 
volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? I am visualizing a 
nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these 
specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
alternate point. 

Then, just a general question.? Are any of these named alternates also 
delivery points, as well as receipt points?? Are there any delivery points in 
these areas that should be recognized? 

I will talk to you first thing in the morning. 
Thanks. 
Larry

Hey,

I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave 
him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him 
something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  

Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of 
course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny 
that you wrote that to my from your work email.   

Well it's about time I got started working today.

What's It Worth To You?

Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.
- Oscar Wilde

Certainly too few consumers and policymakers understand the value of renewable energy products - products that avoid the acid rain, smog, global warming, and soot pollution caused by mainly coal-burning power plants. Perhaps with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year, the Duquesne Light service territory will be the first market where both price and value of renewable energy are understood and motivate large numbers of customers to buy (see case studies that follow).

Moreover, a new study published in the August 24, 2001 edition of Science, by Mark Z. Jacobson and Gilbert M. Masters of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, shows that the ""cost gap"" between coal power and the cheapest forms of renewable energy is narrowing sharply, down to about 0.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most importantly, professors Jacobson and Masters document that the apparently slightly lower cost of coal generation is more illusion than reality, due to its real costs.

When coal generation's environmental and health costs like damage to air, water and forests, as well as human illness and death, are included in the calculation, coal generation's real price jumps to about 5.5 cents to 8.3 cents per kWh. By comparison, the 4.0 cents to 5.0 cents cost of wind energy makes it a bargain. 

""Wind energy is unequivocally less expensive than is coal energy,"" say Jacobson and Masters.

How Much Is That Kilowatt-Hour?
It's not surprising that few know the value of renewable energy products in electricity markets where many real pollution costs from burning fossil fuels are not included in the price of electricity and where many consumers still don't know the link between electricity generation and environmental and health damage. 

Yet lack of knowledge goes beyond value in electricity markets. Consumer inexperience with these markets and the complex transition to competition make electricity an exception to the rule that people know the price of everything. 

Even sophisticated observers don't know the price of comparative products, regardless of the added environmental and public health costs. Price transparency is a bad joke, because stranded cost charges make understanding price as easy as getting a clear view on a smoggy day in Houston.

In those states that allow customers to choose a generation supplier, few consumers and policymakers know what their local utility charged for generation prior to competition, including what are now called stranded costs. Perhaps even fewer know how prices alone, not including the stranded cost charges, of today's competitive products compare to their utilities' unbundled generation rates charged prior to competition. Or how today's renewable energy prices compare to utilities' pre-competition generation rates. 

And how many know how today's price to compare or default rate compares to the pre-competition, monopoly generation rate (which includes stranded costs)? Confusion on these basic questions is widespread and distorts perception and policy. 

It is vital for policymakers to know the answers in order to formulate wise policy (see for answers, ""It's All in the Numbers,"" E3, Vol. 3 No. 12). But even that's only the foundation of what is perhaps a much tougher question about electricity: ""What is it worth?"" 

An important change that will affect the answer is on the horizon. Beginning in February, 2002, stranded cost charges will be eliminated from electric bills in the Pittsburgh area. These are payments made to Duquesne, primarily to cover its prior investments in uneconomic, nuclear generation, recovered from consumers through the Competitive Transition Charge (CTC).

The following examples of typical types of customer bills in the Duquesne Light territory illustrate comparative prices at pre-restructuring or present default rates, the new default rates that will take effect next year, and for various renewable energy products. 

These examples will hopefully clear away some of the haze surrounding the true price of renewable products.

Residential Customers
A typical residential customer (rate RS) using 600 kWh per month has been paying Duquesne Light about $75 per month since rates were capped in 1996. Of this monthly $75 bill, about $48 is for total generation costs and the rest is for distribution services.

In turn, more than $20 of the $48 total generation cost reflects stranded cost charges. Since customer choice began, all 600 kWh residential customers - including those choosing a competitive supplier - have had to pay Duquesne the same $20 for stranded costs. If customers were not required to pay Duquesne for its stranded costs, this typical customer's total bill would be less than $55, a whopping 27 percent less than it is now.

As a result of stranded cost charges, customers choosing a competitive supplier can only avoid paying Duquesne about $28 of its $48 generation rate, where the $28 reflects the ""shopping credit"" or price to compare that has been available. So, only if a customer could buy 600 kWh per month for less than $28, including transmission, would s/he save money by switching to a competitive supplier. 

As you can see, stranded cost charges and the weird economics and pricing they produce make it difficult to know the price of electricity, let alone the value of renewable generation. 

If our typical residential consumer purchased renewable generation today for 6.0 cents/kWh, the consumer would pay $36 for generation - $12 per month less than the historic regulated generation rate of $48. At a rate of 7.0 cents/kWh, the same consumer would pay $42 for renewable generation, or $6 per month less. The price for renewable generation must be over 8.0 cents/kWh for the consumer to pay more for it than what residential consumers paid their regulated utility for mostly coal and nuclear power. 

There are presently four competitive suppliers offering five renewable energy products in Duquesne's territory (three are Green-e certified), for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.0 cents/kWh. Renewable generation today costs substantially less than coal and nuclear generation did prior to competition. Yet, the $20 stranded cost charge that a 600 kWh renewable energy residential customer must pay in the Duquesne service territory has concealed not just the value of renewable energy, but also its real price. 

Until February, a customer buying renewable generation for 7.0 cents/kWh - or $6 less than the pre-competition rate - will still have a total bill, including CTCs and distribution charges, that is $12 more than their current bill. While many might find that $12 more per month for cleaner energy and its associated benefits is still reasonable, many more who are motivated by their wallets alone probably would not. But a great opportunity is about to open up for renewable products as CTCs in the Duquesne Light territory are about to be eliminated. 

While the Public Utility Commission still hasn't established what the new regulated rates will be, it appears that a typical 600 kWh per month customer who buys generation from Duquesne/Orion will receive a rate reduction of about 16 percent, saving about $12 per month. However, customers won't receive the full savings from the elimination of CTCs because a portion will cover the costs of Duquesne's integration into the PJM-West Independent System Operator.

But as soon as the stranded cost charges are removed, a typical residential consumer could buy renewable energy products and pay less than what s/he paid for electricity under default rates, and less than s/he paid in 1996. Both the price and value will then be motivating factors for buying renewable energy.

When the CTC is removed, the residential customer using 600 kWh per month will soon be able to use the savings to buy wind energy to serve one-third of his/her load - for a total of $68, or a savings of $7 compared to today's default rate. Even if the customer were to buy all of his/her electricity from one of the new wind farms being built in southwestern Pennsylvania, the customer would pay less than $3 more per month than s/he is currently paying for default generation.

If the customer chooses a blended product with both renewable and non-renewable content for 6.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill would be $5 less than what it is today. Even at a price of 7.0 cents/kWh, the monthly bill for a blended product would be less than $1 per month more, or only about $8 more per year, than the price currently paid for default service of mostly nuclear and dirty coal-generated power.

The end of CTCs in Duquesne's territory will allow a residential customer to switch from traditional, dirty generation to renewable generation and still save money, or pay only pennies more.

Business and Institutional Customers
The dollar impact for larger customers is somewhat higher, but equally small in the context of total electricity bills or company budgets. For example, a small commercial customer on rate GS/M, such as a restaurant or convenience store, using 10,000 kWh per month and with a demand of 23 kW, has been paying $808.52 per month for regulated or default service. 

With elimination of the CTC and the PJM-West integration costs, their bills will likely decrease about 11 percent, for a total monthly bill of about $720, a savings of about $88 per month. A small commercial customer could use the savings to buy enough wind energy to meet 25 percent of its load - saving about $26 per month compared to present bills, and still paying less for electricity than in 1996.

A large commercial/industrial customer on rate GL, such as a large hotel, hospital or a small college or manufacturer, using 1.168 million kWh/month and a demand of 2,000 kW has been paying about $69,440 per month for regulated or default service. With elimination of the CTC, the bill will likely decrease about 8 percent beginning around September, 2002, for a total monthly bill of around $63,900; a savings of about $5,540 per month. 

Those substantial savings could then be invested in purchasing renewable energy without increasing electricity bills above either current or 1996 levels. For example, a hospital could serve 30 percent of its load with a blended product for 5.5 cents/kWh and still save about $1,225 per month compared to its current default bill. Two hospitals could purchase the entire output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to supply over 15 percent of their total electricity requirements and still save about $5,200 per month compared to their present bills. Even if a single hospital purchased the output of an entire wind turbine, enough to serve 31.4 percent of its load, the total additional cost of $3,209 per month would be only about $3,840 more per year than their current default bill.

For hospitals, which must fight the devastating health effects of dirty coal-generated power every day, how much is that worth?

Municipal consumers on rate SM for street lighting, using 110,000 kWh per month, have been paying $33,130 per month for regulated and default electricity. With elimination of the CTC, the bill would decrease to $27,220, but with the PJM-West transition costs the bill may decrease about 14.5 percent, for a total monthly bill of $28,320; a savings of about $4,810 per month.  About three municipal customers with that consumption level could join together to purchase the output of one of the new wind turbines in southwestern Pennsylvania to meet their entire electricity load and still save about $2,850 per month each, compared to their current default costs. A single municipal customer could still save about $880 per month compared to their current bill if they purchased a blended product at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

What *is* it worth?
What will renewable energy be worth to Pittsburgh's families, businesses, institutions and governments? Buying renewable is the single best thing any consumer can do to protect our environment and public health. Its value is great and its price in Pittsburgh will become less distorted with the removal of stranded cost charges from consumers' bills next year. The savings of $20 per month for a typical residential customer and much more for typical commercial, industrial, and municipal accounts, gives Pittsburgh a great opportunity to become America's first green-powered city. The price of that opportunity will cost less than what consumers paid for dirty power in 1996 or even what many are paying now. 

The value of that opportunity is priceless.

I haven't seen it come back.  I spoke with Lynn around Christmas, and he said 
the person who would sign was out of town, but was supposed to be back last 
week.  I'll be glad to follow up.   I was out last week and just haven't 
worked to that point on my ""to do"" list.

NEPCO and EECC have signed, by the way.

Thank you for the e-mail.  I tried to contact you on your mobile several 
times in the last few minutes but I cannot get through.  Is there anyone 
besides Lauren who can help us in her absence?  I understand the GDRs were 
purchased and the account must be opened.  We cannot do anything without 
background documentation.  Also, we cannot find any information about the 
purchaser on the Enron corporate workbook.  Do you have a list of 
officers/directors?  You can call me at 713/853-5620.  Regards.  Sara

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.

Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002-2006 Plan versus Dave's analysis.

For the Plan, we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change.  The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization (with and without) based on the Plan runs.

You will have a reasonable apples-to-apples if you compare the amounts at the Operating Income level because Dave did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but Dave's is Tax.

There are only two significant differences:

1)  For conservatism, Dave used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004.  In Dave's calculations this made a difference of  about 2.9 cents (77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts. ) for the customers other than FP&L in 2004.  There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts, lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates.  (Per Dave, in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included.)

2)  We got a lower Ad Valorem tax estimate from Ted Ryan than what Dave used.

Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's 
proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also 
apply to the ISO Board's recent decision.

Subject: Motion for Interim Relief by CPUC



Mary:

cc: Ron, Jim

I have had a quick read-through of the CPUC Motion, as requested. There
would appear to be two salient points.

1) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. These
would be imposed using a formula based on ""margina1 heat rates"" times an
index gas price. So the maximum cap would be around $100 and the minimum
could be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/MWh. Needless to say this
does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. It was
also completely make redundant any trading into California. The prices would
rise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyone
to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. The mechanism is
basically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts, but without the capacity
payments.

2) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketers
to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at
FERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. They claim these are
like the UK and Australian ""vesting contracts"", but these involved
significant capacity or options payments as well. CPUC request that all
generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of
cost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated).

Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the
market for up to three years, and eliminating any potential profits from
current long positions in the market.

The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if the
objectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in. The
decision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based on
whether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC's order, making
the CPUC Motion irrelevant. If there is any chance that the CPUC could be
taken seriously their motion should be opposed, as the restrictions on the
market are quite onerous. Any players with long positions in the market
would stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at these
levels.

I was thinking about what to get Dad for Christmas and I think what he would like most is a family portrait.

Joan has talked to Leigh-Leigh Baillio about taking pictures of the family. The sitting fee is $85 (if other family units want pictures it would be an additional $20 per family plus the cost of film). The cost per picture varies by the size and quantity ordered. Joan is getting actual prices from Leigh-Leigh. As a rough estimate, Joan spent about $300 on three 8x10's plus some smaller prints.

I thought we could take the portrait after Jim & Marianna's second baby is born . . . maybe the weekend of her baptism? . . . so there wouldn't be any actual money paid until the Spring. If that's a problem, instead of a Christmas present, we could give him the portrait for a combination father's day/birthday present.

I'm headed to Houston right now. Call me at mom's or we can talk about it at John's house on Wednesday."

I prepared these bullet points for AReM based on an e-mail Dan Douglass sent questioning the constitutionality of the CPUC's action.  AReM's PR firm will turn this into a hand out.  Jeanne is getting back to me on the legal arguments.

Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

Just heard this on an IEP call and wanted to pass it along.


SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

Dear Vince:

It was great talking to you on Friday. Thank you very
much for the opportunity and your time.

After having talked with you and other people in the
group, I was very impressed by Enron research group's
deep insights, high professionalism, and the friendly
attitude. I really wish that I could have the
opportunity to join the group and contribute to the
future success of the research group with my solid
background in finance and econometrics.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me
know. I look forward to hearing from you soon, thank
you very much.

sincerely,
Charles

Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --Sally

I gather that Mary has taken extended leave.
Can you advise who might know anything about this system?

Mary,
Are you around - your voicemail message has said you were out for the day, for weeks.
We have a need for a CRM system, but not a very complicated one, and I thought that the one that Tony Mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might fit the bill. He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities!

Thanks,
Richard

Subject: Canadian Tax Mitigation

Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are 
meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should 
keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on 
your radar screen for your discussions with Wes.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable;


CORRECTED ISO ABA NUMBER:    121000358

ISO Account # 14897-03272



Third Notice - The ISO  faxed the initial monthly FERC Fee invoices to
Market Participants yesterday afternoon.

However, the invoices did not contain the ABA number associated with wire
transfers to the ISO FERC Fee bank account.

Therefore, please use the following Bank Account information, if paying the
invoiced FERC Fee on a monthly basis.

ISO FERC FEE Account Information:

ABA # - 121000358
ISO Account # 14897-03272

ISO Settlements & Finance

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The following notice outlines the FERC Fee description, process and payment
options for ISO Market Participants.

FERC Fee - Market Notice

Introduction

FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the
Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the
ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ? 61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure
for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants.  The
California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim
exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and
request that they be exempted from charges.

Process

One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,
the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each
market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data
sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions
for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total
balance outstanding.  A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and
can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.

Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved
Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to
cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2
of the Tariff.  For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an
annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those
payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after
FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.

Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO
Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual
basis.  Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision
within one month of receiving your first invoice.  Any SC payments received
by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account.  Interest earnings
will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling
Coordinators.

A final invoice will be issued annually,  by fax, after the FERC announces
the final rate after April 30 of the following year.  This invoice will
contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load
and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the
year.

To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing
that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission
transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the
FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,
location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be
exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect
any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any
disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's
settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the
total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid

Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using
preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change
once the settlement's data is finalized.  Market Participants will see the
revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data
sheet.


Timeline

The ISO will issue  invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing
this afternoon.  The process and timeline described above will begin with
the April Preliminary Invoice.  The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will
contain invoices for January through April.

If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.

Subject: New real options presentation

All

Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation, which I'll be 
presenting at a Real Options Group conference in Cambridge next month.

I've removed the gas storage pricing example, and instead put in a simple 
example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches (should 
one wish to do so).  This is a response to the heavily decision-tree 
dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at.  I 
want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and 
option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option 
valuation.

My presentation now covers:
1. Decision trees.
2. Binomial option pricing trees.
3. Power station valuation.
4. Power asset development.
The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic) 
binomial tree method.  I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most 
correct way to do this.

Steve

For those of you who have signed the release forms  (copy attached) your details on file  with Tindall & Foster will be forwarded to Fragomen (UBS Immigration  Counsel) shortly.

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and 
EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer 
filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power 
into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for 
these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  
We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.

Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC 
power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar 
to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file 
specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the 
industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  

Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  
We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may 
be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi  
37007.

		 Subject: Greening the Enron Building Mtg

Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune 
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a 
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for 
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities 
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them 
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let 
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending 
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any 
""headroom"" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in 
order for the ""greening"" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be 
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, 
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings 
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost 
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the 
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the 
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max 
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of 
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to 
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the 
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs 
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for 
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change 
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take 
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and 
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on 
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the ""best"" press for 
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that 
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our 
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100% green 
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company 
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks 
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy 
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, 
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the progress.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

Kate,
Good morning, hope you had a good weekend.
I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.  The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS. Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.  You may want to walk over and ""remind"" them of this.

I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.  Hopefully everything will work.  If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell.
John Anderson will be in at 8.  Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.

Thanks,
Bill  "

Bob circulated a revised version of this document this evening and I have revised it further attempting to add some language regarding the customers ability to lock into a fixed price at any time, if the price is acceptable to both parties.  I do not think that the language that I have included is sufficient and look forward to your comments on this matter as well.

Thanks.

Gillian

The October 16 Southern RTO filing is finally up on its website at 
www.southernco.com.  Look at the RTO documents and presentations.  They have 
filed it as a petition for declaratory order asking that the Commission 
approve their Gridco structure and rate proposal.  I did talk with FERC staff 
yesterday when the filing was not on the web and told them that Southern was 
the last to get their proposal up on the web.

		 Subject: Re: Enron Response to October 15 RTO Filings/Southeastern RTO

I don't have what Southern filed.  I understand the filing will be on 
Southern's web page (www.southernco.com) within a couple of days.  I'm in 
Virginia at the SERC Joint Committee Meeting and won't get the filings until 
I get home Friday night.

As for an independent Board, as long as Southern owns the transmission assets 
as it does in the proposed for-profit Gridco, there is about zero possibility 
of them agreeing to have no say in the selection of the Board or in setting 
the incentive plan.  What specifically are you concerned about (the selection 
process or the incentive plan or both)?  I think we have a shot at getting 
them to consider changing the setting of the incentive plan to let the Board 
do it, as long as it is restricted such that it cannot impact the value of 
the assets.  Any thoughts?

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow."

If you work in West Power Trading, congratulations!  All West Power Trading 
employees are eligible to receive a pair of tickets to a Blazers game this 
season, compliments of Enron.  If you are interested in getting a pair of 
tickets to a Blazer game, come by Mt. Hood Conference Room at 11:30 a.m., 
Monday, November 6.  

We will draw employee names from a hat (or container) to determine the order 
of selection.  Once the order of selection has been determined, there will be 
a signup sheet with available games listed, and you can sign up for the date 
that works best for you by signing your name next to the available date.   If 
your name is drawn, you will have one minute to write your date selection on 
the signup sheet.  Listed below are the dates available for selection, so 
plan ahead and be ready to select from remaining dates once the selection 
process begins.  Greg Wolfe or Chris Foster will be there to oversee the 
signup process since I will be in Houston for training Monday through 
Wednesday next week.

Guidelines for using the tickets are as follows.
  - Eligible employees can receive a pair of tickets.
  - The employee who is given the tickets must attend the game.
  - Tickets cannot be sold or given away.
  - The guest can be a friend, spouse, or another Enron employee.
  - If the employee cannot attend the game, the tickets must be returned to 
me or Debra.
  - Any complaints about this process or the guidelines will result in 
forfeiture of tickets.

If you are going to be out of the office on Monday, November 6, please let me 
or Debra know.  Arrangements will be made for you to get a pair of tickets.  
Call me or Debra if you have any questions.

	Jennifer,

	Please use the attached file for the income to record on companies 0436 and 01A1 related to EOTT income from the ""leased"" assets.

	Note that the O&M to be billed EOTT for company 0436 is rollup AFR-436 less cost center 111795 and for company 01A1 is rollup AFR-1A1 less
	cost center 112109.

	I'll be on vacation next week but if you have any questions leave them on phone mail and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.  It appears I will not have 
	email or internet access.  If you wish to call me I can be reached at 212-581-1000.

	Thanks,
		Tom

John, 
You caught me.  I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, 
and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.  I did promise Chris that I 
wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I 
couldn't do a lot of emails from home! - there is always a catch!

Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one.  

Hope all is well in merry old England.

Cheers,
Mike

Subject: Skeletal Remains Found on Nolan Ryan's Ranch

FYI - My daughter just called to tell me that their seismic company just 
found a body (skeletal remains) on Nolan Ryan's bull ranch China Grove (don't 
know if that is a town or the name of the ranch), off of County Road 521.  
Ryan is just the tenant, the property belongs to Claude Hammel.

Sara - Leica is doing extremely well. She will be 11 at the end of this month
and is still as frisky and active as she was 10 years ago. I suppose sooner
or later she will mimic her owner and slow down! I trust Chloe and her
sibling are doing wel also.   I still own my condo in New Orleans but lease
it to the world's best tenant- a fagotski eye surgeon who pays a lot of rent
and is only there about 10 days a month.When I go down in Dec. (I'll be there
from Dec. 7 to the 27th-will you be there?) , I am planning on staying at the
Avenue Plaza on St. Charles. I'll have plenty of room if you'd like to  join
me.
      I still have Corky's in N.O. which is run by Alan Diamond. We are going
to the Beau Rivage Resort at Biloxi on Dec. 6 for our manager's party. Want
to join me? Am I invited on your family's annual Xmas trip?  Where are we
going? How is your family?
 My mother continues to do well. Bev is in Memphis with a boyfriend and Helen
is in Pensacola and a little more stable these days.
      Mr. Casey and I now have 13 Wendy's in Fla. and are trying to buy/build
more. Want to go inspect them? How is work?
      How are you? Do you miss me? I miss you!     Sam

Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.

It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.

It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.

Tell Don I said Hi.

Mark

Mark,
You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
write.

Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
of you.

We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
were still living in a hotel then....

I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??

All best,
Hal

Mr. Taylor:
I attach the most current query from the September State Summary File.  It would be ideal if you could obtain data from the October State Summary File because then all of the data sent to you regarding your latest data request would be from October.  

BTW, the naming convention with this data is ""enronxxxx.xls"" where the x'x are the month (10 or 09) and the FY ('97, '98 '99 '00).  This file is also in Excel v. 5 format.  

Let me know if this data fits the bill.  Same billing information as with the previous data.

Mr. Taylor:
Here are the emissions data files from the appropriate State Summary
Files for the years 1997, 1998, 1999.  The attached files are in Excel
v. 5 format.  If Excel v. 5 format is not acceptable I will be able to
send them to you in ASCII.TXT, comma-delimited, first row of data used
as field names format.  Let me know if you want them in the latter
described format.  This data is just for the TNRCC account numbers
supplied in your request.  

Please let me know if this data is acceptable.  There is no charge for
this data because it is not the entire State Summary File for each year.


I want to thank you for typing the account numbers.  This saves me
considerable typing time when setting up the queries.

Jim,

I wanted to know how I would find this data.  I am looking for the NOx
emissions for the accounts below for 1997-2000.  I have some of the data
for 1999, and very little for 2000.  How do I find the rest of the data?
Website?  Database?  I believe you sent me the state database in August
which included some 1999 and 2000 numbers for the accounts below.  I
suppose some more accounts may have been updated for 2000.

Subject: RE: TNRCC State Summary File


Mr. Taylor:
1)  The allowable data is generally unique to each permit.  Because of
this a general statement like ""the allowable tons/year for SO2 in Harris
County is ......."" would not be defendable or valid.  
2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the season
of year and part of the state - a.k.a., ""ambient background threshold"".
In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probably
would be lower.  
3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25
years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap for
certain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will be
adjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could be
as little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permits
are initiated.  
4)  Texas charges corporations a ""tax"" for emissions over their
allowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I am
being very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.  

Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answer
as possible.  I hope I am not being too pointed but to the data oriented
person, the previous points are important for data integrity.  Jim Parks

Jim,

Could you please explain to me where these numbers would NOT be
accurate?  I was warned that the data (allowables) would not be 100%
accurate because of certain reasons.  Can you please detail those
reasons for me?

Let's meet in the next few days to discuss this issue of other groups selling 
your services as long as you are the desk, get to price and structure all the 
deals and make your quote with an appropriate margin in every deal.  Clearly 
we would have to initially put together a product menu for the EA group so 
they can understand what they are pitching as well as designate a person from 
your group to work with them so that the story gets told accurately to the 
potential customers.

Thanks.

When we talked about me speaking at the conference in Nov. Enron's management 
conference had not yet been scheduled.  Now it has and, of course, it 
conflicts... it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at 
Enron.  I will take care of finding a substitute, but wanted your thoughts on 
a couple of candidates:  how about Seabron Adamson, Richard Tabors or Scott 
Magrane(sp?).  The latter is at Goldman Sachs and, last time I talked to him, 
was working on Transcos.

Let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at FEBA 
so I can take care of the problem.

It looks like Bankers Trust Company (CP# 27) needs to be unsuspended.

Jason,

Per the below notice from Legal.  ""Bankers Trust"" is still a valid Trading 
entity, and we should continue to book Trades to this Entity.  Can you please 
change GCP from ""Suspended"" to ""Active"".

Thanks,
Joe

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.

On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO.

Some positive aspects for EPMI:

States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical 
merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages 
consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other 
systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is 
seated and given its approval.

Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:

Under the definition of ""Spot Market Service"" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""or be deemed to elect.""  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a ""zone of comfort"" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Best,
Jeff"

Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

  Bill Giuliani

I made a few small changes to the storage balances on CGAS.  I had to create 
a new deal ticket starting Sep 1st because the name changed from CES to ""The 
New Power Company"".

Joanne,  I made a change to Aug 31st.

Kyle, I think you need to change tagg.  

Let me know if anyone has questions.

Status Report re: tape transcripts

At this time, this summary has been sent to you only.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
exchange for our providing similar information to them.

He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, 
the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
equipment.

As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
the period of September of 1999 to the end of October.

The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover 
the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999.

With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim 
of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has 
asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.  
We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in 
time, they have not responded to us.

If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend 
to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this 
particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.

Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not 
particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
flavour of the matter to our benefit.

On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will 
advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see 
exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
Powerex and Enron.

We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.

Yt
Web Macdonald

I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much 
rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for 
Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  

I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, 
I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types 
of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow 
and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent 
reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.  
After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan 
to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can 
use the same format.  

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily 
report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track 
compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of 
determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency 
of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations 
against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I 
will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.

is this the latest?  Also, how are we coming on an operational position 
report?  I know it would be rough but I would like to start producing 
something sooner rather than later.  Thanks

Rick - You had asked a while back for a matrix that captures all of the 
different systems used by commodity, by office and by functional group.  This 
(draft) version encompasses Houston and London activities.  We will expand 
this document to include other offices and products in the next few months.  
Let me know your questions and comments.

Don't know what works best with your schedule.  Ernie Pitterelli (head of Operatins for UBS Americas) will be here on Monday and Tuesday and one of the things that we will discuss is the risk roles - position rerporting and calculation of P&L.  Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations, so it could be helpful for you to be here.  What was Wes' response?  --Sally

My name is Eric Efron and I am an intern in the tax department for EES.  The 
reason I am emailing you is that I am related to Kathy Knott and she had told 
me that she knows you real well and she wanted me to meet you.  I know you 
have been busy and out of town recently, so I figured I would just email you

Dear Johnny Palmer,

I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, specializing on
statistics.  I have worked at Citizens Power (now Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading) since April of this year developing software for their
trading desk and risk management department.

In particular, I have implemented state-of-the-art
procedures to price derivative contracts on gas and electricity, and
worked on default correlations among counterparties.

Attached is a html copy of my vita.

Sincerely,

Denise --

Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs? Speaking with Gloria, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.  Rebecca Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.  The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).

I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to ""Financial Guarantees"" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.

Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?

Thanks,

Jim

Please be sure to copy Jim Wood on all correspondence relating to bonds- from a product management standpoint, I think Jim needs to be aware of these issues as failure to maintain bonds will significantly impact our business. .  I still think that  we would want to have a single person responsible for reporting all potential situations that may cause a default /bad pr situation and  notify the EES office of the chairman  in a manner that would allow plenty of opportunity to cure ( i.e., before it is a crisis).  Gloria and Denise, will you take that on?

Subject:	Bond Requirement

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers

Dear Mr Kaminski, 
?
I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in 
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you concerning 
the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again this year - 
brilliant!
?
I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper again. 
The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your contribution, and I 
would me more than happy if you could join us again.  
?
To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the (""technical"") 
topics that are already covered:
?

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001 
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that 
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility 
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)  would 
be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has 
not been covered  yet.

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) on December 4,
2001, posted for public comment a proposed Wholesale Electric Standards
Model (WESM) -- an industry-based consensus process for developing,
maintaining, and publishing standards that promote reliable and
efficient wholesale electricity markets throughout North America.  Such
standards would address, in an integrated way, the whole spectrum of
reliability, market interface, and business practice standards through a
fair, open, balanced, and inclusive stakeholder process.

On December 19, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
an Order Providing Guidance on the Formation of a Standards Development
Organization for the Wholesale Electric Industry (Docket No.
RM01-12-00).  That order directs the industry to reach agreement on the
formation of an organization to develop consensus standards for business
practices and electronic communications.  If the industry cannot reach
consensus on this issue by March 15, the Commission indicated that it
will either institute its own procedures to choose an organization or
will develop the standards itself.

To provide the NERC Standing Committees Representation Task Force
(SCRTF) as well as the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees
the broadest possible input, the Board strongly urges all interested
parties to comment on the WESM proposal in the context of the recent
FERC order.  Commenters should give particular attention to how NERC and
the recently approved North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB)
could collaborate in developing and overseeing a single, industry-based
consensus process to develop standards that assure the continued
reliable operation of the integrated North American electric
transmission grids as well as the development of business practice
standards and communication protocols needed to complement the market
design principles that FERC has announced its intention to develop.

NERC's SCRTF will use all comments received to help shape its final
proposal to the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees in
February 2002.  We also intend to provide the input we receive in this
public forum on the WESM model to FERC for its consideration. 

For additional information on the SCRTF and its membership, go to:
www.nerc.com/committees/scrtf.html. Please direct questions to David
Nevius, NERC Vice President, at 609-452-8060, or e-mail
dave.nevius@nerc.com.

The proposal is posted at the following NERC web site:
http://www.nerc.com/. The deadline for comments is January 8, 2002.

Sincerely,

Heather Gibbs"

Calpine and NRG risk management guys wanted to know if we would make a market in turbine call options - great idea (yours) but I am afraid they want our bid.

Chris,

I have received a number of emails.  Only one (CP&L) was asking specifically about the turbines.  The other two (Calpine and NRG) are more interested in the turbine call option concept as a risk management tool.

I will keep you posted on the contacts.  I placed a call back to CP&L, and email reply to Calpine.  NRG call is planned for the afternoon.  

The turbine option is not clickable yet.  My citrix server is experiencing some problems.  The helpdesk is working on it.

Steve

Eric.  Thanks for the update.  The units are posted on EOL, but no one can click ""done"" just yet and I dont think we have had any activity..

Silence from Chino the last 2 days.  We were supposed to hear Tuesday am.
Marine Diesel is bringing a buyer to site tomorrow.  Supposedly they are ready to go for  a project overseas with a JV between HQ and probably the main utility in France.  They are ready with funds for the deposit.  Of course I've heard that before, but the broker is very excited so it may have some truth.
Nevertheless,  I gather you're pressuring Steve to go click live on EOL.  I understand we need to move on this, and just pray no one is so foolhardy to click until we get these other buyers sorted out (unless it's a front run of these potential buyers Chino and the French outfit).
Also, Tesco is back in the game with the California Power Authority and Water District - their timing is early next week.

Mark

Attached is a summary of the Lonestar imbalance for 2001.

 

As per our earlier discussion,  I met with Dan Fancler to discuss the Lonestar oba proposal.  Dan and I would suggest that a ceiling be placed on the cummulative volume amount and that any volume over that ceiling be required to be cashed out at that month's index price.  This process would serve to limit TW's financial exposure related to the revaluation of volumetric imbalances.

Good news. Kirstee Hewitt accepted the job offer. She will support RAC and 
Credit in London
and will help to close the gap that has recently developed due to involvement 
of Ben Parsons
in credit trading. She is very well qualified for this position and has a 
very nice personality.
We shall bring her to Houston for 6-8 week rotation to get her up to speed.

Attached is a spreadsheet listing the top twenty participants.

Yellow represents Enron Employees
Red represents disqualification due to multiple entries
Blue represents Illinois (a potential problem state for prizing, advice 
received after game commenced).  It is unlikely that this person will place 
in the top five and thus be eligible for a prize. 

Some participant account status have yet to be determined, to achieve this we 
will need to ask potential winners for their EnronOnline login and id 
information. Once account status have been confirmed we can then advise 
winners and have them sign the appropriate release forms before delivering 
the prizes.

The final figures fort the game are:

There is a new tab for each change in Current Shipper Rates.

Attached for your review and comment please find drafts of Amendment 3 to 
Firm Gathering Agreement for Enron and Burlington.   Please review and 
provide any comments.  Hopefully we can get these executed this week.  


Regarding Amendment 2, which was the quality spec amendment, do you have the

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Best,
Jeff"

Louise,

I don't think I have seen you this year - Happy New Year!

I have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of 
some of Sally Beck's group.  I have been telling most people to stick with 
they organisation names e.g. Enron North America or Enron South America, 
rather than Enron Americas/Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want everybody 
to use Enron Net Works, or should the trading support groups use their 
business unit names ENA, EGM, EIM?

See you soon.

Nicki

P.S.  Mark gave me a voucher for Urban Retreat for Christmas, which I am very 
pleased with.  Sue's jealous, she got crystal!

WHY THE RIAA OWES US ALL AN APOLOGY

    When recording industry types last week tried
         to get provisions against music swappers
         included in anti-terrorism legislation,
         they trivialized everyone involved in America's
         fight against terrorism--and proved themselves
         to be absolutely the sort of people who'd do
         anything for a buck.

		 Subject: Information for Call to LA Mayor Dick Riordan

Ken -- Thank you for making next Thursday, May 17 available for CEO meetings 
in California.  We are working to set up two meetings -- one in Los Angeles 
and one in Silicon Valley (we'll call on Scott McNealy's contact person to 
help pull the Northern California meeting together).   For the Los Angeles 
meeting, we'd like you to call Mayor Dick Riordan (213-847-3560) and ask for 
his help in pulling together a group of key, influential business leaders.   
As background, Riordan is a very wealthy Republican businessman who has been 
term-limited out and has not yet made public his future political aspirations 
(a bid for governor has been mentioned by insiders).

You might congratulate him on helping to settle the Writer's Guild strike and 
ask if he'd now like to resolve the energy crisis (He's in a bit of a spat 
with Dave Freeman over who can claim credit for LADWP's success during this 
energy situation -- see attached LA Times article).  You can say you've been 
told that he was one of the clearer heads during the deregulation process and 
were instrumental in keeping DWP out of the regulatory mess.

This is an opportunity for Riordan to help broker a solution, and that's why 
you're calling him.  You met with Robert Day (Trust Co of the West) who 
suggested that you call Riordan and enlist his support.  

Explain about our comprehensive solution -- business support is critical to 
garner political support.

You'll be in Los Angeles next Thursday.  Ask if he could invite and host a 
meeting of key business leaders and introduce you.  I've attached a suggested 
list of prominent businessmen, close associates and personal friends of 
Riordan's.  We'd like to position this meeting as an insider's conversation 
of what's going on with the energy situation.  This meeting should be for 
principals only.

Ask Riordan to identify someone in his office who we can work with to set up 
the meeting.  Enron's consultant in LA (Marathon Communications) will work to 
coordinate the event.

If Riordan is not available next Thursday, ask him if he would ask Eli Broad 
(chairman of Sun America and a Democratic billionaire) or Jerry Perenchio 
(chairman of Univision) to host the meeting.

*Eli Broad - Chairman, Sun America
*Ron Burkle - Yucaipa Companies

Riordan and Freeman's Feud Erupts in Public 
Power: Each questions the other's role in keeping the city free of 
California's energy crisis. 
By MICHAEL FINNEGAN, TERENCE MONMANEY, Times Staff Writers


?????With California mired in energy troubles, Mayor Richard Riordan and his 
former power chief S. David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Los 
Angeles: no rate hikes and no blackouts. 
?????Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by 
waging bitter campaigns to discredit each other--at first behind the scenes 
but now in public. 
?????Pettiness, ingratitude, conflicts of interest, overblown claims of 
achievement: Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem to 
have good reason to pat each other on the back. 
?????To Freeman, who has resigned as general manager of the L.A. Department 
of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, it 
seems Riordan resents his high-profile role in trying to steer California out 
of the energy crisis. 
?????So the mayor, Freeman charged, has elbowed his way into energy issues 
that he is ill-equipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could 
harm the environment. 
?????""With all due respect, I have 25 years of experience and knowledge--and 
he has 25 days,"" Freeman said. ""But he's the mayor, and he didn't like it 
that I didn't just say yes to everything he came up with."" 
?????To Riordan, Freeman's efforts to fight air pollution have given short 
shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles. The mayor 
said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between 
his city and state roles in the power crisis. And he scoffed at Freeman for 
saying he had lifted morale at DWP. 
?????""Morale was terrible under him,"" Riordan said. ""I mean, they are so 
relieved right now."" 
?????The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about 
egos. City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud, 
successful men unable to say, ""I couldn't have done it without X, Y and Z."" 
?????""Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being 
recognized as the boss,"" she said. 
?????Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings. And the mayor, 
a Republican multimillionaire, has taken pains to play down his dispute with 
Freeman, a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks 
with a Southern drawl. 
?????In an interview after his resignation, Freeman laid out the conflict 
point by point, often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor. One of his 
concerns, Freeman said, was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor 
could reverse the agency's progress in protecting the environment. 
?????Freeman cited Riordan's plans concerning coal-fired power plants in 
Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP, the nation's largest 
municipal utility. The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, 
Nev., a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that 
shrouds the Grand Canyon. The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plant, 
but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale. 
?????He described the mayor's move as a sign that Riordan and his appointees 
on the board that oversees DWP were ""completely insensitive to the fact that 
that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the 
West."" 
?????""I've worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity 
into the DWP policy,"" Freeman said. ""And I am concerned as to whether the 
current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity, and what they 
might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress we've made."" 
?????The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central 
Utah. Riordan has proposed building a new coal-fired generating unit there, 
but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause. 
?????In both cases, Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance 
between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los 
Angeles at an affordable cost. By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and 
expanding the Utah plant, Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes 
of natural gas--and the sharp rise in ratepayers' bills that would follow, 
Riordan said. 
?????Natural gas, which provides 26% of the fuel for DWP plants, causes less 
air pollution than coal, which provides 51%. The rest is mainly nuclear and 
hydroelectric. Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part 
because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power 
providers. 
?????""I favor clean air and more natural gas, but not to the point where 
we're going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles,"" Riordan said. 
?????On the Mohave plant, Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the 
city's share to a buyer that would simply continue running it. 
?????""It's still going to be coal-driven,"" he said. ""How does selling it help 
the environment?"" 
?????The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis 
has worsened. With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverage 
in stories on how L.A. has dodged the crisis, Riordan and the DWP 
commissioners began to view him as ""too big for my britches,"" Freeman said. 
?????The conflict reached its peak on April 17, the day Freeman resigned to 
become the governor's advisor. The DWP board president, Kenneth T. Lombard, 
said the mayor told commissioners that day that ""it made the most sense to 
release him immediately."" 
?????""All we were doing, frankly, was release him from his responsibilities, 
and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us,"" 
Lombard said. 
?????From Riordan's standpoint, Freeman needed to be stripped of his 
authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest: The city 
utility sells surplus power to the state, so Freeman would be on both sides 
of the sales. 
?????Freeman, who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state 
power crisis earlier that day, was outraged at his sudden release, in part 
because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees. In an 
interview, he called the conflict of interest assertion ""complete malarkey."" 
?????""The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the 
interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous, considering 
what I've accomplished here,"" he said. 
?????Brian D'Arcy, who heads the union local that represents 6,000 DWP 
employees, agreed that Riordan and his commissioners ""kind of ran him out of 
here. For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a 
howdy-do is absolutely tacky,"" D'Arcy said. 
?????Riordan said Freeman deserves ""an A-plus"" for his work at DWP. The mayor 
conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done ""to hurt Los Angeles."" 
But, he added, ""when you have a conflict of interest, you have to act before 
anything happens."" 
?????Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP, not just by the mayor, 
but by the agency's board and the City Council. In 1998, he called for City 
Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of 
directors. The proposal went nowhere. 
?????Freeman's concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday. The 
Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP. It calls for 
restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed. But Riordan and 
Galanter, who chairs the Council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, rejected the concept. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times

Please send the following to all of East Power:

A re-org memo was sent all Enron North America employees yesterday.   A 
statement was made regarding the sale of ENA's ""East Coast Power"" facilites 
(Linden, Bayonne & Camden NJ) which are currently jointly owned with El Paso 
Energy.

The sale is not yet final and involves another party that could potentially 
hold up the transaction if they had knowledge of the pending sale.   
Therefore, it is imperative that no discussions take place regarding this 
pending sale.   If the third party were to discover the assets were going to 
be sold, the $$ value of the transaction to ENE's shareholders could be 
negatively effected.

Please respect the internal & external confidentiality of this transaction.

Jim, I agree - lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation 
at these ISO's (not unlike PAC) and ensure that FERC is not abdicating their 
responsibilities.

The three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a 
number of issues.  

Jim, I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your 
new role.

Delainey

Dave --

To your direct question of should Enron take a more active role in supporting 
or nominating Board members, I agree fully.

I would add the following thoughts:

First, I think that Enron's key position in terms of ISO / RTO governance 
should be that Boards (or the leadership and staff of transmission providers) 
should be indifferent to the price at which the commodity trades.  ISOs and 
RTOs should only worry about transmission, not the price of the commodity 
they are transmitting.   Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are 
proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations.   

Also, Enron needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market 
authority to ISOs, especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by 
state political figures.  FERC is responsible for ensuring just and 
reasonable rates, not some stakeholder Board established by state 
legislation.  We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this 
authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to 
impose any market changes.  

Finally, given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a 
""financially indifferent"" transmission provider under Order 2000, Enron must 
take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current 
ISOs.   A good example is the way that Dan Allegretti works within the 
NE-ISO.  These Boards and the ISOs are fundamentally political 
organizations.  Our representatives must take the time to get to know the 
people so that when key issues arise, we are able to influence the decisions.

Thanks, 

Jim

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti 
is putting plan in place.

Delainey

Here are some FERC cases I'll probably be working on in the next month: (1) 
In Docket No. EL00-95-?, et al. the Cal ISO and EOB's Motion for Issuance of 
Refund Notice and (2) Cal PX Compliance filing and request for expedited 
Commission guidance in EL00-95-015.  Also I'll be assisting Gary Fergus and 
Richard Sanders with our discussion with the ISO about reporting cost of 
service information.  That's about as far ahead as I can see at the moment.

reporting on items that have occurred.  The report is due to ENA management 
the first week of each month.

 Please provide information on the current status and upcoming events for the 
following projects by Friday, March 2, 2001.  The report currently indicates 
the following:

PROJECT	KEY ISSUES	STRATEGIES/COMMENTS/NEXT ACTIONS
Antelope Valley	Interconnect ion Agreement.	Reviewing agreement for consistency with business 
objectives and FERC requirements.
		

 Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.  I can be reached at

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of 
worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, 
compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed 
prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a 
few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
""You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, 
long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably 
either average could be defended mathematically,"" said Nettie Hoge of The 
Utility Reform Network. ""We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the 
contracts are very convoluted and complex.""

Subject:	Supported Internet Email Addresses

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put 
mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions 
regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I 
think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as 
""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it 
is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't 
show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, 
like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost 
recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which 
obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the 
outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever 
reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, 
the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer 
must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the 
ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm 
happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the 
document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe 
that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., 
""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the 
language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this 
document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or 
anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, 
do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in 
hearing me out earlier).

Best,
Jeff

=09=09 Subject: Action Items from IEP Lobbyist Call

Summary of action items from today's IEP member company lobbyist conference
call:

Discussion re: SB 28x (Sher) and direct access

- Chris Ellison and I are meeting with staff from Sher and Wright=01,s offi=
ces
to discuss amendments to SB 28x to make it more comprehensive.  I will
report to IEP and members the results of the meeting in my weekly
legislative status report tomorrow.

- IEP has an appointment with Asm. Cox on Tuesday at 8:30 am.  The message
to him is support linking SB 28x and a direct access bill with SB 5x, and
oppose =01&California first=018 language and changes to the outage and main=
tenance
coordination (i.e., AB 60x, AB 8x, and SB 39x).  IEP members are invited to
join.  Please let me know if you are going to attend.  I will report to IEP
members the results of the meeting.

- In the meantime, since SB 28x is likely to be heard on Monday, all
available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members of
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee to support SB 28x with
the caveat that we would like to see some additional changes.

Discussion re: AB 60x (Hertzberg)

- Available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members o=
f
the Senate Energy Committee to oppose AB 60x.  The message is twofold: 1)
the bill creates another obstacle in the siting process when the state
should be streamlining it; and, 2) as a net-importer, California would be
sending the wrong signals to its neighboring states that send us power in
our time of need.  I will forward under separate cover the agreed-upon
amendments that we would be willing to live with if we can=01,t kill the bi=
ll.

Discussion re: AB 8x (Migden)

-  All available IEP member company lobbyists will, once again, make contac=
t
with Assembly Member Migden's office to support a meeting to discuss IEP=01=
,s
proposed amendments to make this bill work.

Dear Vince:

It was great talking to you on Friday. Thank you very
much for the opportunity and your time.

After having talked with you and other people in the
group, I was very impressed by Enron research group's
deep insights, high professionalism, and the friendly
attitude. I really wish that I could have the
opportunity to join the group and contribute to the
future success of the research group with my solid
background in finance and econometrics.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me
know. I look forward to hearing from you soon, thank
you very much.

sincerely,
Charles

Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions
I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all 
the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority.
John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature
If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron
together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround
Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9
thanks

Greetings:

See attached ""meeting notice.""  This could be a good opportunity to get our 
demand-side proposal on the table.  

Dennis:  If we could get some power point slides together, we could present 
our ideas to this group and the leg aides mentioned.  Let me know your 
thoughts. 

Also attached is a summary of the bill that the CA Assembly passed today.  
Please pass this along to others who might be interested. Thanks.

				FTR Auction Participants
				ISO Market Participants

				Re: Potential Participants in the 2002
Annual FTR Auction:

				The ISO is actively involved in preparing
for the next auction of Firm Transmission Rights (FTRs) set for mid-to-late
January 2002.  The upcoming auction will be very similar to the auction held
last year.  The FTRs to be auctioned will be in effect from April 1st, 2002
through March 31st, 2003.

				If you are interested in participating in
this year's auction, please send an e-mail stating your interest to Jim
McClain by COB Monday October 15, 2001.  Jim's e-mail is jmcclain@caiso.com
and his phone number is (916) 608-7072.  Please provide your company's exact
name and acronym, e-mail address, physical address, phone number and the
person to whom we should send the required auction information.  Entities
notifying the ISO of their interest in the 2002 FTR Auction will be added to
a more focused distribution list.  After gathering responses from all
interested parties the ISO will only send FTR-related information to this
specific distribution list.    

				The ISO is evaluating the training
requirements and schedules for potential auction participants along with
other information related to the 2002 auction.  We will post this
information on the FTR Auction site at
(http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/ftr/) and distribute it directly to the
potential FTR Auction Participants.  This site will be different from last
year's site to avoid confusion between the previous and next auction.

				Thank you for your assistance.

Kevin,

I have followed up on your request to identify a potential hire
from Akamai (a person familiar with their technology). We can start 
discussions with the targets in a few days.

Please, let me know which unit in EBS is a potential hiring agent.
If it's Research, who inside EBS can sponsor  this position? We have to 
discuss
the responsibilities and job description.

I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on 
Friday evening.  Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group.  
His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved 
up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.  
Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which 
resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four 
year-old daughter.  

Several of us will be attending the funeral today.  Over the past several 
weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a 
fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic 
association.  Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the 
playground equipment was far exceeded.  "

Dave, attached is our settled form of product description and GTC we have 
prepared for a HDD Australian weather swap. The GTC has been prepared on the 
basis that the GTCs will apply even in instances where there is a Master 
Agreement with the counterparty.     

Susan/Heidi - I  would also like a specific sign off from someone (presumably 
Price WaterhouseCoopers) that the input tax status of commodity derivatives 
(as outlined in the Australian Tax Office Consultation Paper on the 
application of GST to financial services) will extend to weather derivatives.

We are preparing similar documentation for the following, HDD swap, HDD Call 
Option, HDD Put Option, CDD Swap, CDD Call Option and CDD Put Option.

Interested in any feedback.

Steve,

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
at low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
assuming you can still run it by the Analyst/Associate program. They closed 
the books
for the summer.

Let me know if you run into any roadblock. I shall try help you from here.

Vince

Do you have any views on taking summer interns here in the Research group in 
London?  One of our Analysts has recommended a friend of hers (resume 
attached).  I'm sure we could dream up some work for an intern, so let me 
know what you think.

Many thanks,
Steve

Hi Will,

Again, contract number 96063077 appears under the deal clearing tab.  This is the incorrect contract number and I the correct one is not under the Global contract number dropdown box, which it usually is with our Ontario deals.  Can you please help me with this problem as soon as you have a minute.

By the way, SoCal has actually been remarkably helpful in reaching agreement

News Brief:
+TXU Europe puts gas assets up for sale
FT Energy's Gas Daily Europe reports that TXU Europe is putting its North
Sea gas assets up for sale. The utility confirmed today that is in
""preliminary talks"" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was
""very early days"". The move follows ""a number of unsolicited expressions of
interests"" in the business, including its operatorship. TXU said it is
reviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell at
its conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review.

A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: ""The business
has changed a lot in the last year."" TXU has already put up its UK
generation assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets could
mark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analysts
believe that assets no longer give ""competitive advantage"" to energy
companies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gas
and electricity.

TXU's principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2%
of the 83bn ft? Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft? Ravenspurn
North field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft? Welland field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft?
Schooner field. It also has a number of upstream exploration licences and
interests in pipelines.

I watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with Benson.   He 
definitely got good blocking but he showed power, speed, balance, vision.  I 
believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success.  His 
interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also.  I'll take 
over 800 yds next year if you take under."

Although we will miss her greatly, both personally and professionally, we 
wish the best for Kim Ward who will be moving to Houston to be part of a new 
Gas Middle Marketing Group.  She will  be focusing on marketing physical and 
financial trading products to gas consumers in the Southwest and California.  
Kim was part of the first pioneering crew that moved to Portland to start-up 
our trading operation.  Her contributions have been tremendous.   Kim's last 
day in the Portland office will be Tuesday, December 19."

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

I thought you might appreciate this email.

 Subject: FW: 11 things In Life - worth reading

1. It hurts to love
someone and not be loved in
return, But what is more
painful is to love someone and
never find the courage
to let that person know
how you feel.

2.  A sad thing in life is
when you meet someone who means a
lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was
never meant to be and you just have to let go.

3. The best kind of friend
is the kind you can sit on a porch
swing with, never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation
you've ever had.

4. It's true that we don't know what
we've got until we lose it, but
it's also true that we don't know what we've
been missing until it arrives.

5.  It takes only a minute
to get a crush on someone, an hour to
like someone, and a day to love someone- but it takes
a lifetime to forget someone.

6. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.

7. Dream what you want to dream; go where you want
to go; be what you want to be, because you have only
one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.

8.  Always put yourself in the other's shoes. If you
feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the person too.

9. A careless word may kindle strife;  a cruel word may
wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving
word may heal and bless.

10. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

11. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, ends with a tear.
When you were born, you were crying and everyone around
you was smiling.  Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one smiling and everyone around you is crying.

Send this to your friends and send it back to the person who sent
it to you.  Print this out and keep it in your pocket or purse and
pull
it out whenever you need a hint for Life. Always remember - Life
is precious, don't let it slip by.

I talked to Kathy, gave her some basic advice to relay on the subject and

Alcoa and did we need to send them an override letter?

I know that master contracts are utilized by EnronOnline but customer wanted

World events and resulting airline-industry actions have led us to reconsider the timing of our annual forum. To allow participants to focus on what needs to be done in the recovery from September 11, and to avoid distraction, we have decided to reschedule our Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference -- originally scheduled during the week of November 4-8, 2001 -- to March 3-7, 2002.

With the four-month delay, we respectfully request that you renew all current conference registrations.  We will continue to communicate news of the conference through e-mail and via our website www.prosRM.com.   We welcome your participation and look forward to seeing you at the event.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need assistance.  

Best Regards,

Subject:	RE: California AG's Invesigator/Gray Davis' Customer Contact

We are considering four courses of action:  a suit against Gray Davis for tortious interference with contract; a suit for an injuntion against the AG; a letter of to our customers; and a letter to the press from one of our customers.  

California counsel is researching whether under California law state officials can be sued for tortious conduct.  The answer depends upon whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity that would normally protect it from such suits.  We may not have a definitive answer to this question until Monday.  If California law does provide for such a waiver, we could sue the Governor and the State for tortious interference with conduct.  

An additional obstacle to enjoining the AG is that the California statutes give the AG broad authority as to how he conducts an investigation.  Still, if we can get evidence that the AG's investigator is making untrue or misleading statements or engaging in some other misconduct (we would need an affidavit from a customer as proof), we could go into court to complain that the AG is abusing his authority.

A letter to our customers could cause Davis and Lockyer to back off.  Neither wants negative reports about them circulating among California businessmen (who they primarily see as potential campaign contributors).  The letter would lay out the ""truth about the California energy crisis and Davis/Lockyer's misguided and politically-motivated search for a scapegoat.""  We could perhaps use Judge Kobayashi's statement in the Dunn subpoena proceeding that the California energy crisis was ""created in part by all arms of the California government"" to support our case.  We could also use published reports (if verifiable) about the DWR's imprudent purchases of power, and cast the AG's investigation as an attempt to divert attention from Davis/Lockyer's lack of any success in addressing the the crisis.  We could thank our customers for not being swayed by the demagogery and rhetoric, and for continuing to be our business partners.  We would want this to be positive in tone.

A fourth response would be a letter from one (or more) of our customers to a newspaper complaining about the harassment by the AG's office.  This letter could make some of the same points as the letter from us to our customers. 

We are still thinking of other approaches.  We will have the answers to the legal questions buttoned up by Monday at the latest.  Please call me with any questions or comments (x52402).

Vicki/Mark, the harrassment of EES's customers in California continues at great pace - it seems like I am getting messages like this everyday.  Can we get a restraining order/sue the government, etc.

This is going to start hurting business soon and is clearly a witch hunt....

Subject:	SF Giants / California AG's Office Communication

David Tagliarino, Enron Sports Marketing Group, received a call today from John Yee, CFO of the SF Giants.  David, John and I got back on the phone this morning.  Following is a summary of our discussion:

John Yee, CFO, SF Giants, received a letter from the CA AG's office requesting their cooperation in an ""....investigation concerning Enron...."".  (John will fax that letter to me and I will circulate it)
John called the AG's office per their request in the letter received
The AG's office was digging for a bunch of information:
total MWH consumed
contract start date
term of contract
general questions about T's & C's
whether Enron had cancelled the contract
who was supplying electricity
copies of the agreements and letters of communication from Enron to the SF Giants
John was generally responsive and indicated that Enron has been great, has honored its contract, still has a contract in place, etc.
John pushed back on supplying any more information without a written request from the AG's office, and then also indicated that they would only supply what was required by law
The AG's office responded by indicating that they may have to subpoena the Giants
John will wait and see what the AG's office does
He will keep us in the communication loop and make sure that we have copies of the communication from the AG's office

Thanks - Dan

Dave,

Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more 
important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas 
organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and 
resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications 
(if any) it might be worth discussing.

Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron 
Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in 
any new opportunities that come about.

Thanks!

Mike

Dr. Kaminski,

Thanks for your answer.
Before I tell you the time frame,
I'll need to talk with my advisor, first.
Because here is an on-going-project.
I need to coordinate the schedule.

I'll appreciate it if you understand my situation,
and give me some time (less than a week, of course).

For your reference,
probably
the dates I'd like to ask you will be
from mid-May to mid-July (2 months)

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Let's ask Jeff Hines(?), our opinion research guy, to put a few short 
questions together and send it out.  We may also want to include a link so 
people can view the commercials again before answering.

Also,  I was talking with Beth Tilney today about our website (and the fact 
that every business unit now feels free to go do their own thing).  We 
thought it would be a good idea to add this topic to the brand conference 
(perhaps as part of an existing segment).

Steve, Notes has the capability to do a quick survey of employees.  The 
beauty of doing it in Notes is that it is the body of the email message, so 
employees don't have to go somewhere else to participate.  The response is 
much higher.  In fact, Sarah and I have used it a couple of times this year 
and it was very effective.  Susan Lopez of Corp. IT Houston is the contact 
(713-853-7947).  Mary

Mark 

Thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign.  The 
challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
benefit and effectiveness of our ads.   We can measure on a periodic basis 
what the CEO/CCO/CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign.   I 
understand this dilemma.

But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
employees think about these ads.    If all else fails these ads should make 
our employees proud to work for Enron - and this is something we should be 
able to measure on a consistent basis.

I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will 
talk about problems and challenges we have - so if you could consider this 
idea I would be very appreciative.  And of course don't get to hooked on 
God's country while you are in Napa.

Thanks!

John

UB Comment 
More on California Deregulation Nightmares
Martin Rosenberg
  
09/30/2000 
Utility Business 
Copyright 2000 by Intertec Publishing Corporation, a PRIMEDIA Company. All 
rights reserved. 
What were California utility regulators and state legislators smoking when 
they devised California's so-called ""pioneering"" stab at electric 
deregulation? The flaws in the scheme they came up with are profound. They 
are also rather easy to identify. 
Simply put, California's deregulation gurus required distribution utilities 
to shed their generation and buy power ONLY through the California Power 
Exchange and predominantly on a spot basis. Generators had total market 
power. 
The utilities - and the millions of Californians that they serve - were 
captive customers. Whatever price the generators could generate, the 
utilities had to pay. They could not use the threat of dropping off the Power 
Exchange system if prices got too high. 
Second, the utilities were stripped of any of the powerful tools available to 
deal with risk. 
Doug Kline, spokesman for San Diego Gas & Electric, says his company had a 
limited ability to hedge - or protect itself against soaring prices - going 
into this summer. It could hedge 10 percent of its power needs up to three 
months in advance. ""We could go into the block forward market if someone 
would accept our proposal,"" Kline said, but ""it's thinly traded."" 
This is where the California scheme borders on being criminally 
irresponsible. Why expose utilities to market risks without providing them 
with means of protecting their customers against wild swings in market 
prices? 
The futures market is complex. But there are some easy patterns to discern. 
Electric prices in many parts of the country peak in the summer when consumer 
demand for air conditioning peaks. They are lowest in the winter. Generally, 
futures prices track these seasonal fluctuations. A few years ago, some wags 
observed that New York Mercantile Exchange futures traders who felt snow 
falling on their necks going to lunch returned to work and bid up the futures 
price of natural gas. 
As one trading company official says, ""It doesn't take a brain surgeon to 
know electricity is going to go up in the summer."" 
This summer it zoomed to 19.3 cents per kilowatt hour, up from 4.2 cents a 
year earlier. 
Demand for power is not up sharply this summer and supply is about equal, 
compared to last year. ""It is difficult to explain a five-fold increase in 
prices,"" Kline says. 
San Diego Gas & Electric in the winter time - when electricity futures prices 
tend to be low - should be able to buy a futures contract for electricity to 
be delivered the following summer. Then, if prices soar, the utility's 
exposure would be limited. 
In their wisdom, however, California policymakers decided to largely deny 
utilities access to the futures market. 
Furthermore, the utilities could not buy power outside of the California 
Power Exchange. 
San Diego tried. ""We applied more than six months ago for authority to buy 
outside the California Power Exchange, and the California Public Utilities 
Commission denied it,"" Kline says. 
The rise of trading Large industries in California can strike a deal with 
competitive suppliers. However, major traders have stayed away from smaller 
users - and consumers - because the margins are too thin. So consumers are 
captive of the utilities that in turn are captive of the California Power 
Exchange. 
Meanwhile, a robust energy trade has been developing in the rest of the 
country. A recent study by the Yankee Group in Boston reports that $70 
billion in electricity and natural gas will be traded on electronic energy 
commodity exchanges this year, up from $25 billion last year. That's a 
healthy hunk of the $225 billion worth of electricity and natural gas sold on 
wholesale markets. 
""As energy-trading firms migrate to these exchanges, over 90 percent of 
wholesale natural gas and electricity will trade across commodity exchanges 
within three years...An expanding trading market will result in $450 billion 
of energy trading by 2005 - virtually all of it electronically,"" the Yankee 
Group's May study states. 
So far, marketers are sitting on the sidelines. Al Butkus, a spokesman for 
UtiliCorp United, says, ""We don't deal in California,"" Butkus says. ""It's not 
an important market to us."" That is an indictment of efforts to deregulate 
the state. UtiliCorp owns Aquila Energy, which last year was the second 
largest wholesaler of power and the third largest wholesaler of natural gas 
in North America. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in late August announced it would 
investigate developments in the California market. The commission will try to 
determine if the market rules need fixing, and whether remedial action must 
be taken because rates are unjust. 
Stephen Baum, head of San Diego's parent, Sempra Energy, says, ""We strongly 
believe that FERC's investigation opens the door for substantial reforms of 
the state's wholesale electricity market, which is not workably competitive, 
and will eliminate the extreme wholesale price spikes that we have 
experienced this summer."" 
While announcing the investigation, as part of a national market review, 
James J. Hoecker, commission chairman, said, ""We do not find finger-pointing 
to be helpful at this juncture."" 
At some point, however, the following conclusions are likely to be drawn: 
- In deregulated markets, suppliers cannot be free to raise prices with 
impunity while consumers are naked to the howling winds of competition. 
Utilities must be able to hedge their risks. 
- If free markets are to work, the benefits of competition must flow to 
residential consumers and other small users. It is not sufficient to place an 
artificial ""cap"" on rates - since costs are still incurred that must be 
recovered at some later date. There should be a profit incentive for 
marketers to court consumers. Factors limiting the emergence of a competitive 
consumer market should be identified and eliminated. 
- California, as large as it is, is not an island. Utilities in the state 
should not be required to buy from the California Power Exchange. 
- California regulators, who declined several requests for interviews for 
this column, and legislators should apologize to traumatized California 
consumers. They should admit they were unequal to the task of devising fair, 
workable deregulation policies. "

Thanks for the draft.  We are informed that the PX has filed in Chapter 11.  
It may argue that FERC's proceedings fall within the automatic stay, and that 
even if they don't, the accounting we are proposing inappropriately overlaps 
the role of the bankruptcy court."

Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is 
moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I 
met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up 
a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so 
that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during 
the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me 
this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so 
that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look 
forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff 
meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

Attached is a revised draft of the Price Posting Agreement for your review.  
Because text has been rearranged and several provisions have been 
substantially reworded, the version of this agreement marked against the 
prior version is not particularly helpful, but I am happy to provide one if 
you wish.  

Please note that I am the only one on the Enron working group that has seen 
this revised draft; it therefore remains subject to comments by the other 
members of the team.  

Instead of providing a redline, I thought it would be helpful to review the 
most substantive changes in this e-mail.  Please feel free to give me a call 
with any comments or questions.

1. As I have discussed with Stephen, you should not assume that we have 
rejected any of your comments if they did not appear in the attached 
version.   Please contact me to discuss, or resend, any comments that you 
believe that we accepted but that are not reflected in this document.

2. Several new defined terms have been added.  Several definitions were 
revised to reflect that eSpeed will be posting prices to a platform operated 
by a separate legal entity that eSpeed will not necessarily control.

3. The defined terms ""Sponsor Material Adverse Effect"", ""Sponsor Regulatory 
Event"", and ""Sponsor Technological Failure"" have been renamed ""eSpeed ..."" 
instead of ""Sponsor ...""

4. Sections 3(a) and (b) have been slightly reworded to reflect the multiple 
platform concept.   Section 3(c) was moved from Section 5.  The standards for 
a party's right to suspend have been revised slightly.  Also, Section 4(d) 
includes a right by Enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of 
mapping errors; this provision also relates to the termination right in 
Section 13 with respect to mapping errors. 

5. Section 4 has been rewritten to reflect the multiple platforms.     

6. Section 5(b) has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a 
set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the Interfaces that will 
govern the parties once they commence operations.

7. Section 6 has not been changed in any significant manner, except for 
Section 6(d) with respect to commissions

8. Section 7 has been moved (it was previously Section 9) and reflects our 
concerns that the means by which contracts are entered into with Enron are 
clearly disclosed to Participants.

9. The parity section has been revised as we discussed -- essentially, Enron 
shall use ""commercially reasonable efforts to ensure parity""  

10. The reps and warranties and covenants have not been substantively 
revised, but separate reps, warranties and covenants are made by each party 
(instead of including both parties reps/warranties/covenants in the same 
provision).

11. Section 12 is new.  We felt that the Agreement did not clearly set forth 
what would have to be done before the parties could start posting prices.

12. We have revised Section 13(a)(i) and (iii) and 13(b)(i) and (iii) 
(termination events as we discussed); 13(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) are new. 

13. Section 14 has been substantially revised, but is still confusing,  
However, the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing 
confidentiality and that certain information that Enron is particularly 
sensitive about will be kept confidential, while other information becomes 
eSpeed's property at some point to do with as it wishes.  Any thoughts about 
clarifying Section 14 would be appreciated.

14. The Indemnity has been revised to include a separate section for each 
party ((a) and (b)), but we do not believe that the substance of the prior 
provision was changed.

15. We need to give further thought to Section 16 and the provisions that 
eSpeed provided to us (Sections 15(e), (f) and (g) in the prior draft).  
While I have discussed this with Stephen and do not object to the point that 
those provisions is trying to make, the language is a bit broad in places and 
we need to spend more time with it to make sure that it does not conflict 
with other provisions of the Agreement.

16. I have tried to reserve the right for the parties to obtain injunctive 
relief, but this section needs expansion -- and I think Stephen had some 
specific thoughts about what would not be subject to arbitration.

17. The Enron Covenant added as Exhibit H is not perfect, but it is

New info regarding LP from what we just discussed at my desk.  They do not want to take the $28.50 price.  They are getting out of their other Jan. contract and will accept power from Enron starting HE 0100 on Jan. 3rd.  This means we need to reschedule their HLH MW's that was pre-scheduled today for Jan. 2nd.  I have told them I will give them weekly updates regarding the power availability.  We can deliver for all of January, but please let me know if anything changes, so I can let them know in advance.  If we drop them again, I don't want it to be without notice.  

They are still interested in buying out the contracts, but will accept power from Enron until a buyout price is agreed upon.

Thanks,
AW"

Also, you should contact Ken's assistant, Rosalee Fleming, to see when would 
be a good time to give ken a briefing and see what else he needs.  I have 
told Rosalee that you are preparing the materials for Ken.

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____"

Ranelle,
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this.  I do have some questions 
regarding the attached notice.  What is the counter-offer methodology and 
when will we use it vs. FCFS.  Our tariff currently allows us to use the NPV 
methodology and does not state that we can use an alternate methodology.    
We need to rewrite the tariff provision.  Until then, we should definitely 
post the alternate methodology that we plan to use for at least 3 business 
days in advance.  Drew and Susan and I are supposed to meet on this subject 
today.  I will get their thoughts as well.  thanks, Maria

Attached is a draft of what could be added to the TW Website's unsubscribed 
capacity section.  This is similar to what was done for NNG so that if a 
shipper was looking for unsubscribed capacity on our Website, they would also 
know we have capacity available on EOL.  The change also indicates that we 
may be using a different methodology for selling/awarding capacity than we 
have in our tariff.  What do you think?

Good afternoon John,

I hope things are well with you.  I am writing to update you on the status of 
your meetings with Andy Fastow, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.  I have arranged 
the following meeting dates and times with Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, (I am 
still trying to work with Andy Fastow's schedule):

Jeff Skilling
December 4th  
2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Ken Lay
December 4th
3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Also, I will attempt to schedule the meeting with Andy Fastow for December 
4th for convenience - this will also allow us to possibly schedule additional 
meetings for the 5th (as needed).  I will let you know as soon as I'm 
successful.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey

A school either is or it isn't. 
> Alabama is. 
> Notre Dame is. 
> Ohio State is. 
> Michigan is. 
> Texas is. 
> USC is. 
> Missouri thinks it is but is not, Minnesota was but is no longer, 
> Wisconsin just discovered what the meaning of ""is"" is, Rice never was

> We have gathered here to establish what is required to be a college 
> football program. 
> Mind you, this is more than an empirical hashing of wins and losses. 
> Colorado won a national title in 1990 but is not a program; Ohio State 
> has not won one since 1968 but is. 
> Determining what constitutes a program is tricky business, as much 
> about feel and intuition as it is churning out NFL talent. 
> Can we whistle your fight song? 
> Can mere mention of your school start a bar fight? 
> Does your school consider it a moral imperative to keep expanding 
> stadium capacity so as to annually lead the NCAA in attendance? 
> Do we need a tow truck to haul your media guide from the mailbox to 
> the front door? 
> If you answered yes, yes, yes and yes to the above, you are likely a 
> program. 
> You have a far better chance of achieving program status if you tee it 
> up in the South, where the ""War of Northern Aggression"" has provided 
> more than four score and seven years worth of motivation. 
> When Georgia (program) beat Michigan (program) at Ann Arbor in 1965, 
> fans deluged the Bulldogs upon their return to Athens. 
> ""It was as if we had a chance to go to Gettysburg again,"" former 
> Georgia coach Vince Dooley says of that victory in Tony Barnhart's new 
> book, ""Southern Fried Football."" 
> What does it take to make our varsity? 
> National titles factor in and tradition is a must, but there is much 
> more to it than that. 
> A program must go the extra yard. 
> Any school willing buy out a head coach's contract, no matter the 
> length or the amount, is a program. 
> Any school that keeps recruiting a player it can't get just to keep a 
> rival school's top recruiter on the case is a program. 
> You probably also qualify if: 
> * The square footage of your school's weight room is roughly equal to 
> that of your town's municipal airport. 
> * You think the 85-man scholarship limit is a communist plot. 
> * You contribute money to only two sports: football and spring 
> football. 
> * You publicly support Title IX but privately think it has set your 
> boys back 20 years. 
> * Hollywood has made a movie involving the program. ""Rudy,"" ""Big

> * Your head coach could run for Congress and win in a landslide. 
> * They name city streets after your coaches and players. 
> * The chief of police keeps mug photos of your players in his top 
> drawer. 
> * Your head coach leads practice with a megaphone, from a tower. 
> * You have a living mascot (UGA, Mike the Tiger, Bevo); although this 
> does not guarantee enshrinement (see ""Ralphie"" at Colorado). 
> To what length will you go for your program? 
> Will one of your players come off the bench to tackle an opponent 
> running free down the sideline, a la Alabama's Tommy Lewis against 
> Rice's Dickie Moegle in the 1954 Cotton Bowl? 
> * Are you arrogant enough (pay attention here, USC and Notre Dame) to 
> keep scheduling top 10 opponents because you believe in your heart you 
> are one national television victory from getting back in title 
> contention? 
> You get program bonus points if you had a coach or player nicknamed

> Notable exceptions: Orin ""Babe"" Hollingbery at Washington State and 
> Texas El Paso's ""Cactus Jack"" Curtice. 
> You are a program if you can overlook your head coach's scandalous 
> extramarital affair as long as he defeats Auburn. 
> You are probably a program if you've had 10 or fewer coaches in the 
> last 100 years. 
> Since 1950, for example, Penn State has employed only Rip Engle and 
> Joe Paterno, who have amassed a combined record of 421-131-7. 
> Penn State is a program. 
> Lastly, and this is very important--it can make or break a program.

> * Your marching band is banned from playing at a game but your team 
> isn't. 
> * You sell your home game to an opponent for financial considerations.

> * You play in a conference that ends with any combination of the

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

I do play guitar, but I am really still just learning.  I can play bit and 
pieces of various songs.  Might be fun to attempt to jam together anyway.  
Are your drums here in Houston?

It's going great!
I told my folks as well and they were pretty surprised.  Houston has been
good to us so far.  Although I have been working my butt off, so I haven't
seen much of it.  I heard you play the guitar.  We could have a little
partridge family band because I play the drums.  Anyway I have been itching
to play for about 3 years (I have been in apartments for that long), so we
should get together and jam if you are interested.
I'll talk to you later,
-Kevin

Hey Kevin,  How is it going cousin?  Found the napkin that you left your

met.  They said they had just been at your wedding not to long before

How's Houston treating you?  Been back to Kenneally's since?  Drop me a

Dear Subscriber:


In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Regards,

Greg Gerdy
Vice President and Director, Product Management
Factiva, a Dow Jones & Reuters Company

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Suzanne,

I left the response (which is a letter from Siemens Westinghouse) on the part 
of my desk which is next to the window.  I MAY have put it in a file folder 
labeled ""Westinghouse"".  The letter references a letter we sent to them in 
the first line.  Please find the letter and fax to Bill.  Thanks a bunch.

Here are my observations:

I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I 
agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk 
for a performance problem.

Is the reference to the ""State"" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?

As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a

Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

12/13/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

By Mark Golden 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent 
System Operator reflect the credit problems of the state's three 
investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean said 
Wednesday.
""We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness,"" Kean 
said. ""They wouldn't have this credit issue if they had a government 
guarantee."" 
Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, 
told Dow Jones Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely. 
""There's no point in talking about it,"" Cortright said. 
The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp 
(PCG) and Edison International (EIX) on watch with negative implications 
Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this 
fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay 
about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers. 
""The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief,"" 
Cortright said. ""Wholesale prices have gotten worse, and every hour the 
situation gets more dire."" 
Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is 
if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers. 
Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties Commission indicated that it 
may do so, reversing a decision made just last week. 
""With new generation coming on, you would expect the rates to decline in a 
couple of years,"" Cortright said. 
The California Independent System Operator almost had to institute rolling 
blackouts Wednesday because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to 
concerns about the ISO's credit. 
California Gov. Gray Davis said that Enron was one of the ""dirty 13."" 
Enron's Kean said that Enron was only offering very limited amounts of power 
to the ISO. 
""We are basically just a buyer and seller. We control only 70 megawatts of 
generation in the state, which we offered to the ISO today because of the 
emergency, but the ISO declined to purchase that power,"" Kean said. 
That small generating unit is located in the southern California, while the 
ISO's supply problems were most acute in northern California. 
""We aren't selling any other power to them right now. Everything else that we 
bought we've sold to other buyers,"" said Kean, who added that Enron had sold 
to the ISO as recently as Tuesday. 
The ISO manages California's electricity grid and purchases last-minute 
additional power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities. The 
ISO then bills the utilities, which are PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co, Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison, and Sempra 
Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
The ISO has 70-day payment terms to suppliers. 
For the past two weeks, and often during the summer, the ISO has been 
purchasing about one-fourth of the state's entire needs at very high prices. 
It's current daily power purchases are running at $50 million to $100 
million. "

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Jan Collins"

ISO FALL 1999 UFE PROJECT
RETROACTIVE MARKET ADJUSTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

June 15, 2000

MARKET PARTICIPANTS & SC SETTLEMENT CONTACTS;

NOTIFICATION OF RETRO-ACTIVE 1999 UFE MARKET CORRECTION

On July 3, 2000, the ISO, consistent with its commitment to the Market
Participants, will initiate Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) market adjustments,
for Market Settlements from August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999.

These adjustments result from the correction of  meter data errors,
identified and corrected by the ISO UFE Project. The Market Participants
have been very cooperative in working with the ISO.  The mutual objectives
were to assure accurate settlement of Imbalance Energy, to rectify start-up
meter data management problems and to minimize UFE.

The overall magnitude of erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project is
approximately 1,100,000 MWhs or $ 70,000,000.  The ISO Settlements and
Metering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specific
market charges impacted, for this period.

Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and be
applied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). The
ISO's intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10
weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements are
corrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlements
constrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plan
completion by the end of Summer.


The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Market
charges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be charged
to the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that no
adverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive the
associated charge type credits.



FINAL REPORT TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS - Fall 1999 ISO UFE PROJECT

On August 21, 1999, UFE in the PG&E Service Area increased substantially,
ranging from 4-15 %.   This inordinately high UFE continued in excess of
typical amounts of UFE for this UDC Service Area (-1 to +1%), for four
months.

The ISO actively investigated potential systemic causes for this order of
magnitude increase in UFE.

ISO efforts consisted of a concerted review of SQMD submitted by SC's during
this period, a review of the ISO MDAS polled meter data for ISO metered
entities, a review of interchange data (exports), a review of the
Transmission Loss calculations used by ISO Settlements to calculate UFE by
UDC, an investigation of the Market Redesign Settlements software changes
associated with the drop of new Settlements software in mid- August and the
retention of a data consultant to help identify and isolate any causal
factor, attributable for the high UFE .


The effort to identify UFE related settlement issues for the period of
August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999 is complete.  The ISO UFE Project
team, working in conjunction with Market Participants, identified over 1.1
million MWH of erroneous UFE. This UFE is now accounted for, and will be
reassigned to the responsible SCs. The ISO Project identified over 14 casual
sources of UFE during this period.  Many of the issues identified were
interrelated.

The last major source of UFE for the period was identified in April. This
UFE resulted from an erroneous Validation, Editing and Estimating (VEE)
factor, applied to firm load within the PG&E Service Area.  This error,
associated with late or missed meter data adjustment, commenced October 1,
1999 and resulted in understated SC load of approximately 100 - 267 MW/hour,
through December.

The balance of the SC meter data management errors previously identified
were attributable to the complexity of using Pseudo Resources and Logical
Metering to model, schedule and settle Municipal UDC existing contracts
(ETCs).

The four primary SCs which experienced meter data problems, within the PG&E
UDC Service Area, have resubmitted corrected Settlement Quality Meter Data
(SQMD).

The ISO will initiate retroactive UFE Market adjustments for the Settlement
period of August 21,1999 through December 31, 1999.  The magnitude of the
Market UFE adjustment is approximately $70 million. These retro-active
Market adjustments will complete the Project Team's work on the Fall 1999
UFE issue.


Present UFE Status:

March 2000 UFE, based upon Final Settlement Statements (FSS), is as follows:

System UFE         +
0.22 %
PG&E UDC Service Area UFE   + 0.17 %
SCE UDC Service Area UFE    + 0.44 %
SDG&E UDC Service Area UFE   -  0.45%

you have an estimate of when Ice Drilling may come to a conclusion and how 
much more $$$ it will cost.  Kristi gave me a year to date schedule if that

Maureen --

Thanks for the information on the switching of the ""held"" customers.  We will process through a standard EDI transaction.

I am trying to find out who would work up the credit amount.  When I find out, I'll e-mail you.

Thanks,

Jim:

Sorry we have played phone-tag.

The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1) the reference in
your Dec 4 letter regarding re-enrolling customers for switching to Enron,
and 2) the listing of Massachusetts Electric as a creditor in Enron's
bankruptcy filing.

The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon
our conversation last week.  This does not put them on 'hold' for a later
switch, since that is not feasible or appropriate.  The customers simply
remain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they
choose otherwise.  When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the
customers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch
transaction as usual.  If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier,
the switch would be processed.  We assume you'd take care of any contract
updating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter
between you and them.  Hope that clarifies.  Please let me know if
questions.

Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could
answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the
creditor section of the bankruptcy filing?  We'd like to speak with someone
ASAP.  Thanks.

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized."

Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman 
paragraph:

 ""Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the 
Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing 
Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the 
Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Currently, Janet is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination 
organizations.""

Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the 
meeting and deliver the ""Enron"" message, but going forward we need to have 
this resolved.


Cheers, Paul D

RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said Monday it will invest 
$455 million in its gas distribution business in Brazil from 2001 to 2004. 
Robert Gross, vice president of Enron's Brazilian unit, also said the company 
plans to spend $970 million on thermoelectric projects, but he didn't specify 
any timetables for the projects.
Gross said Enron will spend $142 million on gas distribution projects next 
year in Brazil. 
Currently, Brazil's energy regulator Aneel is in the process of licensing 
companies to build and operate a total of 44 new thermoelectric plants. 
U.S.-based Enron primarily operates in Brazil as a gas and energy 
distributor.

a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern

Subject: PRC

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

No, did you?

Hard to believe that its' still falling after today's news:

HOUSTON, Jan. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN - news) today 
announced that the company will significantly exceed previously forecasted
 fourth quarter recurring earnings of $0.22 to $0.25 per share. In addition, 
the company also reaffirmed that it is comfortable with the upper range of 
current 
estimates for 2001, which will represent an increase over 2000 of about 30 
percent."

Jim,

The pilot RTO Info Database is attached as per your request. Please 
understand that this is a preliminary Draft of the database. 

The database is pretty straightforward. The first page contains a list(with 
links) of the current RTO in the database.
Document links for the talking points/Key issues have been completed for 
DStar, Florida, and Southeastern.
The others will be completed shortly. 

I welcome any suggestions/concerns as I will be changing most of the fields 
of the database on an ongoing basis.

DH

p.s. If you have problems entering text or making changes the password to 
unprotect the workbook is ""Achilles""

FYI.  It appears that the California Governor is working pretty hard to stop 
this market.  We are looking into the politics behind this letter, especially 
who in the administration drove this dramatic response.

Subject: California Governor Comes Out Hard for Price Caps

Just received by fax a press release and letters sent by Davis to Jim 
Hoecker, the Chair and the CEO of the ISO, the Chair and the CEO of the PX, 
the Pres. of the PUC, the Chair of the Energy Oversight Board.  The language 
is highly charged and negative.  Tim/Bob:  Note call for caps on PX 
equivalent to caps in ISO real time market.  In sum:

Letter to Chair and CEO of the ISO
Apply to FERC for extension of rate cap authority
Apply to FERC for finding that market is not competitive.
Reduce wholesale price cap to lowest reasonable level.

Letter to Chair and CEO of PX
Apply to FERC for bid caps in day-ahead and day-of spot markets equal to ISO 
caps in real time markets.

Letter to Pres of PUC
Wholesale electricity market lacks competition.
Support filings that he's asked the ISO and the PX to make at FERC.
File a petition with FERC requesting a finding that ""no competitive market 
currently exists in California, and requesting an extenstion of the price cap 
authority...""
Refund immediately to SDG&E consumers the $100 million dollars SDG&E ""found"" 
in an account

Letter to Chair of Energy Oversight Board
Urge ISO to petition FERC for extension of price cap authority
Urge ISO to lower caps to lowest reasonable level
Urge ISO to file petition with FERC for finding that ""no competitive market 
for energy exists in California""

Letter to Hoecker (cc'd are Clinton, Boxer, Feinstein, Farr, Lewis, Burton, 
Brulte, Hertzberg and Baugh)
""...there is virtually no price elasticity in this market, and little 
prospect of change in the short run.""
If FERC's investigation finds abuse, FERC should order refunds to consumers.

As we're beginning to see the second wave of Order 637 proceeding technical 
conferences being scheduled, here is a brief update on the proposed 
timetables for the first few dockets.  As December kicks off, we are in a 
settlement mode in all the cases, with most pipelines in informal discussions 
with customers/parties to work towards consensus settlements that can be 
filed with the Commission.  

** Note that Koch, adamant that segmentation is not operationally feasible on 
its system, has circulated a settlement proposal on segmentation.  See below.


ANR, RP00-332: 

 After three technical conferences at FERC, ANR is committed to developing a 
total consensus document.  ANR is circulating their latest revisions to 
customers by December 7th, and customers are meeting without the Commission 
or the pipeline to discuss ANR's proposal on December 15th.  A follow-up 
technical conference at FERC is scheduled for January 11, 2001.


Dominion, RP00-344:

Dominion has held at least five meetings with customers to work out a 
settlement in this case.  A technical conference, originally scheduled for 
late October, has been rescheduled with FERC Staff for December 14th.  This 
should be a meeting on a settlement proposal.


Koch, RP00-340:

Koch has circulated revisions to its Order 637 filing, including a settlement 
proposal for segmentation.  There will be a conference call among Koch and 
its customers on December 5th to get comments on the tariff revisions as 
discussed at the October 25th technical conference and the new segmentation 
proposal.  After that call, a follow-up technical conference at FERC should 
be scheduled for sometime in January.

[The segmentation proposal would allow customers broader supplemental rights 
in the zones in which their primary receipt and primary delivery points are 
located.  When points are located in different zones, the customer would be 
entitled to utilize its full MDQ in each zone (in essence doubling their 
MDQ).   It's critical to Koch's offer that all segmented transactions will be 
scheduled on a supplemental basis, as this is the only protection for the 
operational integrity of its system and primary firm services of other 
customers.  The right to segmentation can be waived by customers and it will 
be available on a prospective basis only for new or renegotiated contracts.  
Koch is also proposing a ""segmentation fee"" to be assessed either to those 
customers utilizing segmentation or by all Koch customers (undecided in the 
proposal).  This fee will be used to recover all costs associated with 
developing the segmentation program and necessary computer system.]


Colorado Interstate, RP00-325:

CIG will circulate revisions by December 1st to its compliance filing as 
discussed at the pipeline's second technical conference on October 26th.  
Parties will send comments to CIG by December 10th.  The schedule, from that 
point, will go into January.  CIG may follow Dominion's lead and schedule 
settlement meetings with parties before meeting with Staff again.


Tennessee, RP00-477:

Tennessee is circulating revisions based on discussions at the November 14th 
technical conference by December 8th.  Parties will meet within two weeks of 
that date to discuss the revisions (either separately or at a FERC technical 
conference).


Kinder Morgan, RP00-343:

Kinder Morgan plans to circulate a revised 637 package by December 15th, with 
a conference call scheduled for January 4th to get feedback from customers on 
the revisions.  The pipeline believes there may not be a need for a second 
technical conference and hopes to file a settlement and implementation plan 
by the end of January.  "

		""The Administration does not project that the State will
need to make additional State loans to support the DWR Power Supply
Program even if DWR does not issue its revenue bonds as planned during
the 2001-02 fiscal year. DWR projects that its funds on hand at the date
of this Official Statement and projected revenues appear to be
sufficient to finance the Power Supply Program. The cash needs of the
Power Supply Program depend, among other things, on future power
purchase costs, the timing and amount of revenues from power sales, the
availability of additional interim loans, and the timing of the issuance
of revenue bonds by DWR. The Power Supply Act limits loans and advances
from the State under the Power Supply Act after November 15, 2001, to
amounts required for short-term cash flow purposes of no more than $500
million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days.
However, the Governor has the power under the Emergency Services Act to
order additional loans or other advances to DWR if needed to further
mitigate the emergency.

			The State expects to maintain adequate cash
reserves to fund its normal operations during the 2001-02 fiscal year
whether or not DWR repays the State loans during the fiscal year. The
State plans to issue short-term notes to assure that adequate cash
balances are maintained. The State has regularly issued short-term debt
in the past to meet its cash flow needs. See 'State Indebtedness-Cash
Flow Borrowings.'""

31, 2001, $5,700,000,000 State of California 2001-02 Revenue

Subject: base differential for TW deal analysis



Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling

Subject:	Weekend Events.........

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?

About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).  

On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.  

On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.  

The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.  

Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.  

Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.

In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.

Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?  

Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

Regards

Bharat

Mike and Jeff,

The following is an update we sent out to Harvard and Ospraie regarding the 
status of our transaction pipeline.  I thought it would be of interest to 
both of you as well.



Gentlemen,

We have sent the final version of the CA to Hallwood to be signed, hopefully 
we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a 
preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week.   We 
are negotiating a CA with Nuevo and they appear anxious to get started.  
Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items 
to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms.  The DevX CA should be 
finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully 
next week also.  We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake, but I 
spoke with Marc Rowland last week and he is getting his new reserve report 
finalized and will send it to us when it ready.  Benton is progressing albeit 
slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure.  We are also 
analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated 
and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing.  It 
could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity 
participation in the SPV is of interest.  That's it, call me if you have any 
questions or comments.

Doug,

I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly. Also if it is time
to move on other fronts -- Benton / Nuevo -- I am ready to go. I think Nuevo
will probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q and
reducing reserves.

OK, I'm a mindless idiot.  And an embarrassed one at that.  To which offer 
are you referring?  

Also, learned that PG&E's big ""want"" in the Son of Gas Accord is a few 
hundred million to build more Tx and Local Tx.  Sounds like this could have 
an IMMENSE negative impact on TW.  You better get your fanny out here, like

David,

As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment 
agreement.  I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and 
have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement.

I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment 
(salary, options, etc.).

Let me know if you would like any other information from me.

I just wanted to let you know that I know that we are in a hot spot now, but I have all the confidence in you and Enron.

I trust in God, but I have a lot of confidence in you too.  You have kept Enron an ethical and decent company to deal with and to work for over the years.

 I was gone from the company (laid off 5 years ago) but returned 13 months ago and I just celebrated my tenth anniversary with the company and I would like to say that I am so proud to be back working for Enron.  Those five years I was gone, I never lost my allegiance to thecompany even though I was no longer an employee, I felt as though I was still a member of the Enron family.

I have always felt that Enron cared about its employees and in talking with some of my co-workers, those who have been here for a while, feel the same as I do.

I want to let you know that I am praying for you and the company and I know you will bring us through this time of trouble with God's help.

Keep your spitits up.

God bless you.

I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the
offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If
you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!!
Thanks so much.
Whittney Skinner

Natural Gas Futures Continue Higher on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX continued higher
yesterday on more short-covering, gaining $0.041 to $2.291 per MMBtu. The
March contract rose $0.033 to $2.273 per MMBtu. The market opened higher
and traded range-bound bouncing off $2.32 several times as it awaits the
AGA storage report due out this afternoon. Look for a withdrawal about 150
- 160 Bcf reported for last week. Some say that since physical prices
maintained a premium to the NYMEX could be companies buying on the spot
market to keep from pulling stored natural gas that was pumped into the
ground at higher prices. If that is the case, a lower withdrawal and
subsequent price tumble could be in the offing. Physical prices gained
slightly yesterday on nominal cold in the West. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.03 - $0.07 higher
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.04
to $2.36 per MMBtu.

 EPA to Continue Utility Pollution Lawsuits

     The Bush administration plans to proceed with lawsuits against
several utilities for allegedly violating a Clean Air Act provision that
requires new pollution equipment when a plant is expanded or upgraded. The
Attorney General John says the EPA has a reasonable basis for continuing
the lawsuits initiated during the Clinton administration. In November
1999, the Clinton Justice Department sued many coal fired utilities for
expanding or upgrading plants without installing modern equipment required
to control smog, acid rain and soot. It sought to strictly enforce the
Clean Air Act's new source review rules, which exempt power plants and oil
refineries built before 1977 from installing modern pollution controls
unless major modifications are made to the plants. The industry has
bitterly opposed the pollution rule. It claims the regulations prevented
more refineries and power plants from being expanded or upgraded and
limited energy supplies.

the rig count is down, and all those factors. Prices will form a base down
near these levels, and once the storage is worked through, prices will
take off, but it may be July with hurricanes and heat waves,"" said Beaver.

Andersen Fires Partner in Charge of Enron Audits


    Arthur Andersen has fired the partner in charge of Enron Corp's audits
for ordering the destruction of thousands of e-mails and documents related
to Enron. In addition to the firing of the chief Enron auditor, Andersen
said it will place 3 other partners involved in Enron's accounting on
leave and is relieving 4 other partners of their management
responsibilities. The accounting firm says they will put a new management
team in place in their Houston office. Anderson said that the destruction
of Enron documents at its Houston office was on such a scale and of such a
nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good
judgment were violated. The SEC, Justice Department and Congress are
investigating the disposal of e-mails and documents related to Enron as
part of larger probe of Enron's meltdown. Andersen said the document
destruction ended a day after the SEC subpoenaed Andersen's records. House
Commerce Committee investigators believe the fired partner and others
involved in Enron's audit received approval to destroy documents from
Andersen's headquarters in an October 12th memo. But Anderson denied the
allegation, saying that the partner expedited efforts to destroy documents
without consulting others in the firm. Questions have been raised about
whether Enron-related litigation will exceed Andersen's liability
insurance.

Maine PUC Selects New Standard Offer Power Provider

    The Maine PUC hopes to save standard offer electricity customers
nearly $100 million a year. The PUC said that when market prices fall, as
they have during the past year, they will pass those savings along to
business customers with standard offer service, which is the default
energy supplier for those who have not chosen another provider. The
commission accepted bids for new standard offer prices for medium and
large commercial customers in the Central Maine Power and Bangor
Hydro-Electric service areas. The new prices are 41% to 49% below current
standard offer prices, the PUC said. The new standard offer prices for
Central Maine medium and large commercial customers average about $0.042
per kWh. Bangor Hydro prices average $0.042 per kWh for medium and $0.04
per kWh for large customers. Central Maine is a unit of Energy East and
Bangor Hydro is owned by Canadian company Emera. Large and medium standard
offer customers account for about 30% of the load, or about 6.8 million
MW/h per year. The PUC said it selected a one-year contract period to
ensure standard offer prices are in line with the market while maintaining
the competitiveness of the market. The commission said it would release
the names of the provider selected in 2 weeks to allow supply arrangements
to be completed.

Mirant Shares Continue to Tumble


    Shares of Mirant fell for a 7th consecutive day yesterday, hitting a
record low amid speculation of loss of trading business after its credit
rating was cut to junk status last month. The stock dropped $0.77, down
5.9% to $12.21 per share after earlier dipping to $11.80. It has tumbled
24% since January 4th. Mirant CEO claims the company is still doing strong
business and intends to meet with Moody's this week to discuss the
downgrade. Moody's downgraded Mirant to 'Ba1' its highest junk rating,
from lowest investment grade 'Baa2'. Moody's also says the rating outlook
remained negative. A day after the rating cut, Mirant sold stock, raising
$759 million, and said it will shed assets and cut capital spending by
40%.

Details of Enron - UBS Warburg Agreement


   Enron and UBS Warburg, the investment banking group of UBS, have agreed
to a deal for Enron's North American Gas and electric trading operation
that entitles Enron to a third of the profits generated by the new 'AA+'
rated trading entity. It is a positive deal for Enron and its creditors
that confirms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation. Enron
sees it as the first step among many towards an overall plan of
reorganization and planned emergence from bankruptcy. The deal is for ten
years but allows UBS Warburg a series of options to begin buying out
Enron's royalty interest in the 3rd year of the agreement. UBS Warburg's
calls may be exercised in 3 steps, each representing a third of the
royalty stream. Following the exercise of the first call, the royalty
payment rate will drop from 33% to 22%; following the exercise of the
second call, the royalty payment rate will drop from 22% to 11%.  Upon the
exercise of the third call, the remaining 11% royalty would cease.  The
complete transaction documents is available at: www.enron.com .

Others Scarf Up Enron Market Share

    Duke, Mirant, the Intercontinental Exchange and other energy traders
are taking up the slack created by Enron's bankruptcy. Mirant, BP and
Goldman Sachs are among a consortium of businesses that own ICE, whose
energy trades have climbed by 60% since Enron's problems. ICE's owners
account for 40% of the energy market, double EnronOnline's 20% before it
halted trading. The exchange said trading through its online marketplace
for energy products and metals, jumped to $4.3 billion last week up from
December's record high daily average of $2.5 billion. Mirant has seen its
power and natural gas trades increase about 10% to 15%. Duke said its
energy trading volumes have also risen. Enron once handled about 25% of
electricity and natural gas trades and had $100 billion in revenue in
2000, mainly from energy trading. UBS, the largest Swiss bank, was chosen
to buy Enron's trading business for a share of future profits, no cash up
front and the bank will assume none of Enron's liabilities. Enron hopes
that the UBS deal will revive its trading business.

Wind Industry Sets Records in 2001

    The wind energy industry left previous records in the dust with a
blowout year in 2001, installing nearly 1,700 MW, or $1.7 billion worth of
new generating equipment in 16 states, according to the American Wind
Energy Association. The final tally of 1,694 MW was more than double the
previous record year of 1999, when 732 MW was installed, and boosted the
industry's total generating capacity by more than 60% over the amount in
place a year earlier. Current installed capacity in the US is now 4,258
MW, and there are wind turbine installations in 26 states.  However,
prospects for a repeat in 2002 have been thrown into doubt by the
expiration of a key incentive, the federal wind production tax credit,
which expired December 31st and was not renewed by Congress, due to a
partisan battle over economic stimulus legislation.  Bills to renew the
PTC had strong support in both the House of Representatives and Senate,
AWEA said, but were left unpassed when negotiations between the two
parties on the economic legislation broke down shortly before Christmas.

Ex-SEC Chiefs to Testify Before Senate Banking Committee

    Next month, the Senate Banking Committee will have 5 former SEC

   The only valid ""Buyback"" ticket for Meter #: 1373 is Sitara Ticket #: 
246408.  S. Ticket #: 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up 
Buyback 
       ticket across Equistar's meters{1552,1384,1062,1553}. If  you recall 
this process was done to enable Client Services to automate Equistar
       allocation/billing. The project took place around April 2000 
production retroactive back to Jan. 1999.  The link to compute the buyback is 
set up 
       on S. ticket # 246408.

       Since Equistar has begun doing business via ENA, it was necessary to 
establish a ""Buyback Ticket "" on ENA's Matrix.
       Thus, to answer your question, yes there should only be one ""buyback 
ticket"" for meter #: 1373 on HPL  and ENA.

       ENA activity is kept whole and the swing is on HPL.

       I hope I have addressed all of your questions below however, I am 
available for follow up discussion if needed.
 
       It  has been a pleasure working with you. I learned a lot about the 
business while scheduling industrials and thanks for the opportunity.

Robert, 

There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for 
HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company?  
Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract 
and HPL contract?

Hello all:

At Jeff's request, I called 1-800-CRUISES to get some info. Here is what I
found in summary:

Royal Caribbean, ""Vision of the Seas""--glassed in area for viewing
July 17 departure, 7 day cruise                            June 18, 7 day
cruise

$1499/per person, inside room                              $1300/person,
inside room
$1699/per person, ocean view                               $1599/person,
ocean room

Leave out of Vancouver, visit Hubbard Glacier, Skagway, Haines, Misty fjords,
Inside passage, Ketchikan, Juneau.  New ship( built in 1997) 2200 passengers,
 large glassed in area to view scenery/wildlife.

For an extra approximately $900/person, you can add a 3 day land package
which is basically a visit to McKinley and Denali, and probably Fairbanks.
Representative said as long as you are all the way up there, you should go
see the wildlife.

Carnival Cruises goes too but this cruise sounded more suited to mom and dad.
According to the rep, more elegant, good food, etc.

I have a courtesy reservation for the July cruise (figuring it might be
warmer, though she said that June and July are warmest) I got the ocean view
room.

I don't know 1-800 CRUISES   from Adam.  I will try and call my travel agent
tomorrow just to see what she says about Royal Caribbean.

If we do the July cruise and land package, it is $4998 (air fare, cruise,
port costs) for mom and dad which comes to $1300 for each one of us.

I leave Saturday for a week so I'd appreciate some feedback before I go if
possible (not necessarily a commitment, just feedback).  I think they have
this hold for a few days though I don't necessarily think we have to decide
immediately.  If we want to do this, there is a $300/person deposit (didn't
ask if it is refundable or not), with the balance due 75 days before
departure.

What do you think?

Funny how it works, but one of my clients I am doing a year-end deal for also 
found out before I told her.  HORRIBLE.  Oh well.  I guess I need to spill 
the beans faster.

Are you all going on to Ted's dinner party on Saturday?  Sheryl.

Jeff, lets try to get consensus in how the east desk might work and then 
discuss next steps at that point.

Dave,

I know you want to have a meeting about the east desk as a follow up to last 
weeks meeting.  Do you think it would be helpful for me to have this 
replicated for all desks for one meeting?  Or do you want just 1 
presentation, and I will manage the rest of the rollout to the other desks? 

Thanks.  Jeff

Something to think about.  Do we want to try and expand the issues to resolve the Settlement?

Subject:	RE: PG&E

Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Thanks, BT

Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case. "

Subject: HPL Meter



Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).
As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would
plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,
volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this
point.


After visiting the site (M&R 71886/76886), I found the following work that
would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be
performed :
 (The site has two 12"" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)
and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)

1. All valves will need to be inspected & overhauled
     A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this
work)
     B. Control valves - inspected & overhauled (needs to be sent off for
this work)
     C. Small regulators overhauled
2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected
     A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled
     B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting
overhauled and tubes honed)
3. All transmitter need to be replaced
     A. Differential - 2
     B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)
     C. Pressure - 4
     D. Direct mount manifolds - 2
     E. UPS system
4. RTU boards need to be furnished
     A. Mother board
     B. STI REM
     C. Main terminal board
     D. Serial IO LEM
     E. Analog Output board
5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)
6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50"" increments through Beta range)

It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and
associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information
please let me know.

Subject: Retail Deal with Food Industry Alliance Closed

Last week, an aggregation deal closed with the NY Food Industry Alliance 
(FIA). It will be booked with a margin of at least $1.3 million. I sublet 
office space from the Food Industry Alliance in Albany, and I initated 
discussions between them and EES last Fall. I also worked with both EES and 
the President of the FIA in the final stages to bring the deal to closure and 
resolve a number of issues raised by several of the FIA's members. My 
physical location in the FIA's office suite was actually used by the 
President as a selling point to his members in the face of a slighly less 
expensive offer from a competitor.

Elizabeth/Paul:

Please find attached my markup of the Draft Power Sale Agreement with New 
Hampshire Electric Coop.  I have added some important language in Article 
14.2 to reflect that Installed Capability will still be credited by ISO-NE 
even during an outage at Seabrook (i.e., they should have full liability for 
providing ICAP regardless of whether the plant is operating).  The rest of my 
comments should be pretty clear.

We need to have comments to NHEC by noon eastern time, Monday March 13th.  
Please call me at 978-449-9936 to discuss.  Thanks much.

Jeff,

Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told 
him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - 
also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested 
please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy.

per your request, attached is a list of speakers at the Industry Standard 
conference.  It looks like a very strong list. They would like to get an 
answer by Thursday.
My suggestion would be for me to go ahead and RSVP that I will do the speech. 
If McMahon is available and wants to do it then we will have the slot held.

Hello Stephen,

As you requested, here's a list of confirmed speakers. Enron will get a
prime slot on Thursday September 7, though we can move it to either Friday

confirmation from you very soon.

Best,

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want
to do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't
thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like
on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full
novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until
we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers
Trust financial trades and master sit.

ILA: Initiating Coverage of a Pure-Play Energy Merchant

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook
for wholesale energy and the potential for successful expansion into new
commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Subject: Re: APS/Pinnacle West  

Hello Kate,
APS and Pinnacle...We ran into a problem checking out for the end of the 
month, because a few deals had Pinnacle in the system, but Bloomberg on the 
bro confirm.  We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS 
showed the deals as APS on there side.  They are trying to segregate 
companies little by little.  We have been told by Rhonda, our contract 
administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are 
under WSPP.  

DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg 
trade; then cp should be APS.  DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under 
Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.       

Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and 
APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.  No, we will not have problems 
recognizing the old name, Rhonda says they will just be assigned over to 
Pinnacle, but we will not have to revise confirms.  Hope this helps!
Thanks
Stephanie

563906 - changed to Pinnacle West
563907 - changed to Pinnacle West
562226 - changed to APS

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

Kate

Subject: APS/Pinnacle West

Kate, 

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Thanks for your help!
Stephanie

I appreciate all the helpful tips I've received from networking with my
good friends regarding my present job search.  I thought I'd pass along
this example regarding the importance of an attentive interview response.

The Job Interview

Steve, who was born without ears, needed to hire a new manager. The next
day
he had set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything
he needed and was very interesting. But at the end of the interview, Steve
asked him, ""Do you notice anything different about me?"" And the gentleman
answered, ""Why yes, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears.""
Steve
did not appreciate his candor and threw him out. The second interview was
with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. But he asked her
the same question, ""Do you notice anything different about me?"" She
replied:
""Well, you have no ears."" Steve again got upset and tossed her out. The
third and last interview was the best one of all three. It was with a very
young man who was fresh out of college. He was smart, he was handsome, and
he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. Steve
was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question: ""Do
you notice anything different about me?"" And to his suprise, the young man
answered: Yes, you wear contact lenses. Steve was shocked, and said, ""What
an incredibly observant young man. How in the world did you know that? The
young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, ""Well its
pretty hard to wear glasses with no f---ing ears!!!""

HAPPY HOLLOWEEN  FROM SAMURAIMAI  (#457 CLASS OF '73)
  Regarding U T winning the national championship.  What a JOKE!  I have
arranged to have the ""JUNIOR COLLEGE'S"" TOWER here in Austin demolished, as
it is the preferred site for the proposed Blanton Museum.  The tower will
never glow orange again.  It's also on the second tier target list for the
raghead's next flyby.
Best regards.  -KAI-

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

at relate to a pending or threatened investigation or lawsuit. As I am sure=
 you are aware from reading the newspapers and watching television, because=
 of the number of investigations and lawsuits the universe of relevant docu=

ether you destroyed a relevant document. However, many of you have requeste=
d guidance on what must be retained in this category of documents. To that =
end, attached are the various subject matters of subpoenas and document req=

Matty & Geo,

Could you forward this message around for me?  Grassy-ass.
---------------------------------------------------------------

I know it's really early to be looking, but I'd rather get the ball rolling
now than later.  In July, my roommate is moving out to full fill her life
long dream of becoming a domestic partner to a short hairy angry Italian,
and I'll either be looking for a new roommate or a new place.  My apartment
now is in West Newton, it's a 2nd floor 2 bedroom, den, screened in front
and back porch, washer/dryer, Swedish suck machine, etc. and about
$1450/month (includes jack squat).  Anyone interested or know of anyone
who's not a complete psychopath Or doesn't mind living with one, let me
know. L8R

Good Afternoon Kay,

The Mitsubishi equipment was purchased through WestLB.  Additionally I am 
working on the Las Vegas Cogen Project with a WestLB structure.  I am 
purchasing a steam turbine and four HRSG's.  

Give me a call at your convenience and I will give you any particulars 
required.

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Vince:

I enjoyed meeting you last week to discuss my application to join your group. 
Please keep my inquiry confidential for now.

If selected, I think your group would greatly benefit from my diverse 
skill-set including modeling skills utilizing Excel, Access, and
Bloomberg as well as graphing, statistical, and other quantitative abilities, 
especially in the meteorology field.

I am particularly interested in being able to discover vital information 
which may affect the markets (e.g. pulp/paper, interest rates, weather) as 
well as arriving at a new variable which captures all market variables into 
one which may be followed and forecasted for each of the groups.

Furthermore, I am truly committed to adding value to your group, including 
making significant contributions,
and am sanguine about my ability to ensure that these achievements are 
well-received.

I have met many people at Enron thus far and am able to utilize these 
strategic alliances by knowing who may be able
to assist your group in the quest for information on different projects. By 
accessing information quickly, both internal and 
external to the firm, the group would be able to extraordinarily benefit from 
this diligence  In addition, by seeking greater efficiencies in my work, 
I have been able to be instrumental in accumulating additional 
responsibilities. 

Most importantly, I have the mathematical acumen and insight to ensure the 
continued growth and prosperity of your group.

As a research-oriented individual, I am clearly interested in pursuing a 
position in your  group.
If selected, I would be able to bring my diverse experience, including 
financial modeling and derivatives, from my tenure at
Enron and CIBC World Markets.

I look forward to meeting with select members of your group.

Thanks,
David

How are we handling these now?  Last time I talked to Jeff, we weren't going 
to lift the restrictions until next week (assuming we do lift the 
restrictions).  Any word?

Subject: Stella Chan /Project Summer transfers

Steve/ Cindy

Just want to state a case for this move, (before everyone starts up on the 
movement moratorium issues surronding the "" EI"" companies -which I understand 
is still in place).

Stella Chan (Director level) is one of 6 expats Apachi have seconded into our 
SK Enron JV in Korea. Because they all mobilized at the same time, Darrell 
Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early, 
some extend (so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time). Its 
worked well to date, and we've mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the 
moves/replacements.

Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium (in my view) is 
that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 
'intellectual capital' the buyer (or any future buyer) is seeking to retain, 
and so the move should go ahead.

Hope you concur.

Darrell,

Stella Chan's contract will conclude March 1 2001. She had shown some desire 
to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to 
start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she 
has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry 
Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set 
a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000.

This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw 
who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to 
be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please 
pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the 
next step with both individuals.

Thanks


Tony

John,

Credit appears to be a problem on this deal.  Therefore, please stand by for 
further developments.  

I appreciate your very quick response.  Apparently, my client was satisified

Jeff - Thanks for hosting the meeting.  PG& still needs to decide what it
really wants out of the gas accord, but I hope you gained some insight into
our thinking. Keep in mind that Enron is still viewed around here with
suspicion - something we all need to get over with.  I would not give up on
going to higher levels in the company to pursue business opportunities.  I'm
told through the grapevine that you made one attempt and got no response.
Take the energizer bunny approach.  Who knows where it may lead."

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity

about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times=20



By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>

Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=
n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=
ctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it=
s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=
 minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =
ahead.=20

Analysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in=
 seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent si=
nce May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is =
its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week=
 to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. E=
arlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off =
on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Com=
pany, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market=
 conditions improve.=20

The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=
ces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the =
California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo=
r dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focu=
s on using its ""single"" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate=
 in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S=
tates. ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co=
mes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) i=
s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new=
 power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,=
'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference =
call with the media.=20

The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay=
 Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreem=
ent, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $19=
6 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti=
nued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau=
se the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quart=
er. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Gol=
dman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the=
 investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy=
 trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.=
5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryl=
and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa=
rate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be =
part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth=
er.

It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=
 significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck II=
I was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. =
Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Ban=
c. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the =
past seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said i=
t would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating s=
tation in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation=
 Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, =
Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed =
prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nin=
e Mile 1 is not extended.=20

The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=
k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domesti=
c merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per sh=
are of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher =
than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share i=
n earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third=
-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the=
 acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter ear=
nings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and=
 beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confi=
dent that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 =
to $4.10 per share.=20

Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=
rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop i=
n energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pric=
es. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny'=
s 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price a=
ssumptions.=20

The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=
arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=
er. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and soften=
ing wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amr=
o, said there are common themes affecting the industry: ""One is lower power=
 prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower sto=
ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth.""=20

AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second co=
nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and=
 said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s=
elling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES =
was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term c=
ontract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term =
contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla=
t growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were =
very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p=
roduct. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to=
 the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one yea=
r ago in many parts of the country.=20

The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=
ndamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respec=
ts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabil=
ity in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most signi=
ficantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w=
hether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constella=
tion concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business=
 is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others co=
me to the same conclusion.=20

No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

No word yet-
Raul and John Batten are here today trying to sell our services to the new

Rick: Here's the ""draft"" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.

Tanya:
This coming Friday Sara and I are going to walk the legal assistants through 
some basic concepts with respect to the ISDA and CSA Schedules and 
confirmations.  Do you think that we should invite some of the newer credit 
people to this and if so, who?  Some of this will be a repeat of what we did 
a few weeks ago but at a more basic level.  We were thinking that it may be 
beneficial for Nidia Mendoza and Cathy Tudon.  Let me know what you think.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for December 22 is:

syncretic   \sin-KREH-tik or sing-KREH-tik\   (adjective)
     : characterized or brought about by the combination of
different forms of belief or practice

Example sentence:
     Dr. Portman practices a syncretic form of medicine,
borrowing from both Eastern and Western medical traditions.

Did you know?
     ""Syncretic"" has its roots in an ancient alliance. It's a
descendant of the Greek word ""synkretismos,"" meaning
""federation of Cretan cities"" -- ""syn-"" means ""together, with,""
and ""Kret-"" means ""Cretan."" The English word ""syncretic""
retains the idea of coalition, and appears in such contexts as
""syncretic religions,"" ""syncretic societies,"" and even
""syncretic music."" ""Syncretic"" also has a specific application
in linguistics, where it refers to a fusion of grammatical forms.

Please Note: The Word of the Day will not be e-mailed on
December 24, 25, or 26.  The full text for each day's word will
be available at: http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwod.pl

So,  you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to Houston?   Good call there.
I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends.    Deb and I had a great time and the flight was so cheap,  $165.       The weather was awesome and the wine was good 
(  as far as I can remember ).    
Anyway,  it was good to see Stewie, Tim and even Richter.    

What are you working on here,  is it classified?

Sorry that we haven't talked in some time.  I thought that you would want
to take a look at some analysis we have recently completed with regard to
the California Power Crisis.  You may find some of the analysis to be
helpful.  Let me know if you have any questions.

It's going great!
I told my folks as well and they were pretty surprised.  Houston has been
good to us so far.  Although I have been working my butt off, so I haven't
seen much of it.  I heard you play the guitar.  We could have a little
partridge family band because I play the drums.  Anyway I have been itching
to play for about 3 years (I have been in apartments for that long), so we
should get together and jam if you are interested.
I'll talk to you later,

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.

The following power point presentation graphically sets forth the steps 
necessary to integrate MG plc into Enron NetWorks L.P.  This presentation 
differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage 
of the reorganization and solid red lines around the same pieces reflecting 
where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes 
presentation.  Please do not hesitate to call regarding any piece of the 
presentation.  My best to all.  Steve.

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical 
information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14 
so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. 

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will 
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add 
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.  

Thanks, Bryce

be using all of these reports.  If you need me to scale this down to those
currently being used, I will need to do a bit of analysis.  Many of the base

Clay,
     I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

Sounds like a possible approach although it looks like it reports into 3 
policy committee members instead of one. Does Rice have an issue with it 
reporting into us?

Subject: RE: Draft of Organizational Announcement


this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

I've been invited to speak next Friday at a Southern Gas Association 
conference.  I'm the speaker during a ""Pipeline Right-of-Way Round Table"" 
session.
The chair of the session from El Paso natural gas heard me speak last 
December here in Washington on the fiber optic federal lands ROW issue, and 
invited me to talk to the pipeline folks on how the fiber ROW fight will 
affect pipelines.
Attached is my proposed presentation -- I remember you asking some time ago 
to see any presentations we propose to make.
Approved?

Thanks,

Subject: New Product Version - Daily TFX

Tony, I need your review and approval asap for the attached E.Dubuque 
delivery products that are ""daily"" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura 
and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same 
language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as ""R+C).  
This ""Dly"" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled 
over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language 
shown here is the same as the ""daily"" language we have been using.  Call me 
with your questions. Thanks. x7067.

SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000 
   
 06/19/2000 
 Petroleum Finance Week 
 (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 

 Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and 
production expenditures by more than they anticipated
 at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year 
update of its annual E&P survey. ""The 326 companies
 we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent 
rise budgeted in December,"" said James D.
 Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment 
banker.

 He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehman's survey reflects 
increases in budgets for 2000 and not
 underspending of budgets during 1999. ""Among the companies that were 
included in our December 1999 and May 2000
 surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated 
to have been spent during 1999 in December. It
 also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide 
exploration budgets since December,"" Crandell said.

 The survey's respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P 
expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent
 earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven 
almost entirely by independent producers. ""In our survey,
 227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent 
versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the
 year in December,"" he indicated. ""Some 40 percent of the independents we 
surveyed have increased their U.S. E&P budgets,
 while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last 
December. Higher natural gas prices and increased
 cash flow are the main drivers behind this.""

 Crandell said that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: APC), Apache Corp. (NYSE: 
APA), BHP Petroleum, H.S. Resources Inc.
 (NYSE: HSE), McMoRan Exploration Co. (NYSE: RAN), MDU Resources Group Inc. 
(NYSE: MDU), Mitchell Energy and
 Development Corp. (NYSE: MND.A and MND.B), Santa Fe Snyder Corp. (NYSE: 
SFS), Stone Energy Corp. (NYSE: SGY) and
 Titan Exploration Inc. - now Pure Resources Inc. (NYSE: PRS) - were among 
the larger independents to make the most
 significant upward revisions. The ones that significantly reduced planned 
U.S. E&P outlays for the year included Barrett
 Resources Corp. (NYSE: BRR), Belco Oil and Gas Corp. (NYSE: BOG), Burlington 
Resources Inc. (NYSE: BR), Coastal Corp.
 (NYSE: CGP), Forcenergy Inc. (NYSE: FEN), Houston Exploration Co. (NYSE: 
HEX), Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG), Mariner
 Energy Corp. and Williams Production Co.

 The survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage 
gain in their 2000 U.S. E&P expenditures (8.8
 percent) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year (8.4 percent). 
Among the 14 companies in this category, 31
 percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 E&P spending estimates 
during the first six months, including Amerada Hess
 Corp. (NYSE: AHC), Conoco Inc. (NYSE: COC.A and COC.B), Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. (NYSE: OXY)and Total Fina Elf S.A.
 (NYSE: TOT). Another 19 percent - including ENI SpA (NYSE: E), Royal 
Dutch/Shell (NYSE: RDP and STT) and Texaco Inc.
 (NYSE: TX) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates, while the 
remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey
 remained the same.

 'The increase in Canada... is nothing short of staggering...'

 ""The increase in Canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is 
nothing short of staggering,"" Crandell continued. Of
 the 85 companies that he contacted, 44.7 percent budgeted higher 
expenditures for 2000 than for 1999. ""Compared with
 December, 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000 
by more than 10 percent, while 20 percent
 have reduced it by more than 10 percent. The remaining 39 percent have kept 
it within 10 percent of what was originally
 estimated,"" Crandell said. Talisman Energy Inc. (NYSE: TLM) led the group 
with a huge increase, followed by Anderson
 Exploration Ltd. (TSE: AXL), Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (NYSE: GOU), Murphy 
Oil Corp. (NYSE: MUR), Pan Canadian
 Petroleum Ltd. (TSE: PCP) and Shell Canada Ltd. (TSE: SHC). Like their U.S. 
counterparts, producers above the border raised
 their 2000 E&P budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash 
flow, according to the Lehman analyst.

 He said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise: ""The 14.9 
percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas
 companies that have operations outside the United States and Canada was well 
above the 5.7 percent increase for 2000
 estimated last December. As in other geographies, there were more companies 
that increased budgets than decreased them.""
 Overall, Crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised 
their 2000 E&P budgets by more than 10 percent, 43
 estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated 
that they would spend less than originally planned.
 He said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which 
materially increased their budgets, including
 Texaco, Petroleos Brasileiros S.A., Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. and Repsol YPF 
S.A. (NYSE: REP) among the multinationals and
 Amerada Hess, Apache, Premier Oil Plc. and Woodside Energy among mid-sized 
companies.

 Crandell noted that while respondents' average price assumptions rose during 
2000's first six months (to $22.04 from $19.25
 per barrel of crude oil and to $2.58 from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas), they still trail current prices and what
 Lehman Brothers estimates for the year ($28 per barrel of crude and $3.30 
per Mcf of gas). ""This suggests a stronger second
 half than expected, should companies raise budgets further to reflect the 
higher prices,"" he said.

Attached is the proposed form of guaranty that Enron Corp. will provide.  ECT Investments would only collateralize above the threshold, since you would have a guaranty for the rest.

We look forward to receiving your schedule.

Hi Ben,  

Hope the show ended up great for you guys.

Would you mind breaking down the last invoice (four objects) by object so I know the bill for each.  I'd like to send some dough.

Have a great thanksgiving if we don't talk before then--I'm leaving wed for Kentucky, then London.

Best to all,

Jeff

Let's plan to get together.  Maybe you'll come over to our humble little pad
and have a nice home-cooked meal.  Hillary is a really good cook.

I am sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding, Jeff.  I was going to and
then changed my mind when you seemed so stressed and hassled by your
work/travel schedule.  I didn't want you to feel obliged to travel if you
didn't want to.  I should have asked you your preference.  I hope you
understand.

I'm so glad you're okay, relatively speaking.  You're a great guy, Jeff, and
I hope that this experience helps you and me and everybody around us to
focus on what's actually important in our lives, and to be especially kind
to each other.

Please tell me when you're coming around

Warm Regards,
ben

Susan,

I've spoke to our purchasing person, Karon O'gorman, about an order status in 
Omaha.  According to Karon, all purchasing from Omaha and Houston goes 
through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Karon can handle 
all of the arrangements for you.

Thanks,

Today's focus: Super-secret Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network Associates is teaming up with the National Security Agency,
the government's top electronic cryptography and spying institution,
to help the agency fine-tune its highly secure version of Linux. The
goal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside
attacks.

Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development
by the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more
secure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from
software vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security
division of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the
Linux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or
PC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating
system. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off
""buffer overrun"" and ""format string"" attacks, which take advantage of
loose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating
system and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed ""Lion"" was recently
identified as using this method to hack Linux servers.

NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses
in the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux
project to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type
Enforcement protects the operating system and applications by
segmenting them into security ""domains"" with specifications on what
types of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this
could be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an
application, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with
VMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for
allowing users with different security access to work on the same
server.

The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives
is that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once
finished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include
SELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more
bulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626

Paul would like to start his roadshow with Australian customers next Tuesday 
(Monday afternoon, our time).

Could you please review the amendments which David Minns has recommended for 
the PA and  ETA today, so that Paul can take a copy of at least the PA with 
him when he visits the customers?

Thanks,

Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson abo=
ut=20
who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.

Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The ""Details of Jan and July.xls""=
=20
workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday=
=20
and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply cur=
ve=20
becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability=
=20
commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the=20
aggregate reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.

The workbook ""Supply Curve.xls"" has the simplistic, average supply curve I=
=20
mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question=
=20
you are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.

The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:

Tao Guo, PhD, Senior ""Algorithmist""  (916-569-0985) =02=05 the one I was th=
inking=20
of
Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985)
Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) =02=05 more a t=
rainer,=20
but sharp
Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 =02=05 ver=
y=20
resourceful
Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) =02=05 best for questions ab=
out=20
EMSS per se

all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com

Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP=20
(916-569-0985).  He has a laconic style, but is very focused on customer=20
satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.

Regards,
Michael

Michael,

I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I=
=20
am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and=20
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppar=
d=20
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and=
=20
consequently the person to contact in case of problems.

I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provi=
de=20
the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the=20
numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack=
=20
and system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort ea=
ch=20
station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge thoug=
h,=20
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea=20
Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations=
=20
according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station=
=20
Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:

For each hour, for each generating station:

""marginal cost"" [o/MWh] =3D (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh=
] -=20
VOM_cost [o/MWh]

This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a=20
marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above=20
calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea=
=20
Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and=
=20
TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.

Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which=
=20
outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?

It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this cas=
e=20
could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling=20
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

Regards

I think Mike Garred and Dave Scott will be coordinating with you and Scott 
G.  We will probably not get corp guarantees.  So, this is causing our 
finance guys to scramble a little bit.  We will probably be subject to a lot 
of LC's which could get pretty expensive. 

For August, we will operate ""as is"" on the pipes.  There will be no changes.  
However, ENA's contract with CES will be assigned effective August 1.  So, 
all the supply invoicing should come to New Power in Sept.  I will need to 
coordinate with Kathleen to ensure the ENA has ""approved"" the assignment.  

Call Mike and Dave directly to continue coordination on the pipelines.  
Thanks for you help.  I will be sure to get you the golf shirt whenever they 
are produced........??  Meanwhile, you've got my IOU

How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA 
used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do 
this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free 
lunch and my New Power golf shirt?

Subject: New Power Set Up on Interstate Pipelines

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.

in our database giving them info on our ""comprehensive solution.""  Rather 
than attach the solution document as is, I'd recommend a shorter, simplified 
version, plus an overview page that answers ""What does this do for: 
customers?  the state?  utilities?  marketers/generators?""  

Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to 
write/call/weigh-in w/ their legislators and the governor?  Do we want them 
to be signatories on a formal proposal?

Please let me know what you think. 

Thanks.

Hi Karen:

It was good to see you Friday.  I hope you had a nice visit in So. Cal.

I've attached a draft letter to existing list of CEO's from Ken Lay for your
review.  The attached draft letter assumes that the background material from
Jeff will be enclosed and that the sample letter to Gov. Davis, et. al. asks
for support of specific legislation, policies.

If we've got this wrong, let us know and we will try again.

Subject: Project Stanley - History of the Design of the Alberta Power Pool 
Model

I understand your call to me yesterday was to inquire about the vision the 
architects of the Power Pool of Alberta had when they were setting up the 
Power Pool, and more particularly, whether they envisioned that 
unsophisticated Pool Participant would be expected to obtain assistance from 
other more sophisticated Pool Participants to maximize the price that it 
would receive from the Power Pool for the energy it sold into the Power 
Pool.    I have reviewed the some materials (i.e. AEUB Decisions, Alberta 
Department of Energy documents) and have found nothing related to this.  This 
is not surprising as these market design issues were considered in Alberta in 
1994 and 1995, long before I arrived on the electricity scene in 1997.

I did speak to a consultant who was involved in the market design process in 
the early 1990's named Jim Fitzowich.  Jim joined TransAlta in 1986 and then 
worked for TransCanada Power until January 2000 when he established his 
current consulting practice.  Jim became a member of the Power Pool Council 
in late 1995 and stayed in that position until May 1998 when an independent 
Power Pool Council was appointed.  Jim and I are both on the Board of 
Directors of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta and I know 
Jim fairly well.  

Jim advised that the Alberta electricity industry design was quarterbacked by 
the Deputy Minister of Energy of the day named Rick Hyndman.  Under Rick 
Hyndman's direction a White Paper was apparently released in October 1994 in 
which a power exchange regime modelled on the exchange regime in the U.K. was 
thoroughly discussed and proposed for Alberta.   According to Jim Fitzowich, 
this White Paper was the initial blueprint for the Alberta market design.  I 
have met Rick Hyndman a few times and understand he left government a few 
years ago and is also a consultant.  I left Rick a message to call me and I 
intend to ask him to send me a copy of the White Paper and also inquire about 
the nature of his consulting work.  

On a related note, attached is an email I sent to Bill G and John L in March 
2000 advising them of the new Power Pool Participant Behavior Guidelines that 
were added to the Power Pool Rules in March 2000.  You can see the original 
notice of the rule change received from the Power Pool is also attached as 
are the actual Participant Behavior Guidelines (see Change 11a).  While I 
appreciate the determination of whether an offence occurred under the 
Competition Act would be independent of the compliance, or not, with the 
Power Pool Rules, I think it is noteworthy that the Power Pool incorporated 
these entirely new set of Participant Behavior Guidelines only recently, and 
after the acts that are the subject of Project Stanley had occurred.     

You should also be aware that there is a document on the Power Pool website 
(http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/index_links.html) entitled ""Summary of Power Pool 
Rule Changes"" that appears to list all the rule changes that have occurred 
since the Power Pool began operation in 1996.   

Regards,

Rob

Subject: Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Attached are a number of Pool Rule Changes that I expect will be approved 
today by the Power Pool Council.  The most noteworthy change is the addition 
of the new Rule 2.9 - ""Participant Behavior Guidelines"".

The Participant Behavior Guidelines contain very broad language but are 
intended to provide market participants with guidance from the Pool on the 
types of activities that it considers to constitute anti-competitive 
behavior.    It identifies three categories of ""undesireable practices"" 
namely: (a) sharing of competitive information, (b) abuse of dominant 
position (which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or 
energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient, fair, and openly 
competitive operation of the market), and (c) other practices including 
conduct that would cause a material change in price.

In my view, this new Rule does not extend any additional powers to the Power 
Pool or the Market Survelliance Administrator beyond the already broad 
authority given to the MSA in Section 9.1 of the Electric Utilities Act.  It 
is my sense from conversations I had with stakeholders at the IPPSA 
Conference that the Power Pool's motivation behind this new Rule was to send 
a message to Powerex and the PPA Owners that the Power Pool is concerned 
about their market power and is/will be monitoring them.   We need to be 
aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being 
conducted within them.  

It may be worthwhile for Peter and I to consolidate the relevant EUA 
provisions and the Pool Rules into one reference resource for the commercial 
group.   

Regards,

Rob

Last Wednesday, January 24, I held a meeting at the US Embassy with Jim=20

 =20
I believe that the meeting was highly positive since it gave the chance to=

let them know the PPI issue in detail, to make them clear some points of th=

They showed themselves very interested in taking action to help us with the=

a. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, the Argentine Foreign Affairs Minister,=

will meet with Collin Powell in Washington  next February 6. They will try =

c. They will clearly speak about this issue at the regular meetings that th=

Ambassador Welch. Although the topic of the meeting was Stamp Tax they also=

from US. They recommended us to participate at such meeting (also with=20

Thanks Mike.  Jim and I spoke with Eduardo for an hour this afternoon --  h=
e
helped answer some of the remaining questions we had about the politics
behind the Defensor del Pueblo action.  We'll brief the Ambassador tomorrow
and will also meet with CMS on the issue.

You may want to have Joe Hillings raise the PPI-indexing issue with
Argentine Amb Gonzalez in D.C. - it helps to have the Foreign Ministry here
get parallel hits from our embassy and from theirs.  Also note that ForMin
Giavarini will meet with new SecState Powell in Washington February
6....while their conversation will doubtlessly be broad-ranging, we'll make
sure this issue gets into the Secretary's briefing memo.

Best,  Doug

Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  
1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)
2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.
3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. 
4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.
4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.
5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow ""form of agreement"".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. 
6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   

We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.

If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.

With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.  
1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  

2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.

3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  

4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.

5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.

Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:
	1)  Escrow the proceeds
	2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future	
	3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.
	4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)
	
Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation."

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Sarah Rimer"

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were 
involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock 
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.
JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

07/28/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
A-1
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants ""may have 
crossed the line,"" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
""The governor's approach may be convenient for him,"" said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, ""but it ignores the 
law."" 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that ""decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,"" Knox said. ""Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing."" 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of ""a conscious policy of secrecy"" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
""We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks,"" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
""I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer,"" Mead said. ""[He] just said your services are terminated. 
""I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns."" 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
""I don't see a conflict,"" he said. ""At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron."" 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
""We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards,"" he wrote. ""That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters."" 
""Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person."" 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide ""financial advisory services"" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide ""financial advisory 
services"" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

Here is the quick & dirty.

None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not 
placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the 
parties do not commence until the facilities are ""tested and placed in 
service.""  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the 
facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because 
of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.  
EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do 
not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our 
experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, 
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not 
exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing 
capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.

Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be 
best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are 
not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our 
best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the 
compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.  
The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss:  
$25,000/month)
The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.

From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to 
revoke our ""in-service"" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll 
probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some 
reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an 
explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be 
triggered.  
The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject 
to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was ""in 
service"" when we knew it was not.  
The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at 
least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent 
deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of 
longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In 
July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not 
delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs 
full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption 
in mind.

Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a 
memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to 
get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get 
information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will 
be.  "

Subject: FERC reports on Plant Closures in Callifornia and Northwest Prices 
in Nov & Dec

Good News.  FERC issued three reports yesterday:  a Response of the Staff of 
the FERC to Questions Posed at December 20, 2000 Western Governors 
Association Denver Meeting; a Staff Report to the FERC on Northwest Power 
Markets in Nov. and Dec. 2000; and a Report on Plant Outages in the State of 
California.  All three reports can be downloaded from FERC's page on bulk 
power markets, found at http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm. 

From a quick scan of the pricing and outage reports, the results are very 
favorable.  FERC found no evidence that plants were down for other than 
maintenance or emissions problems.  The pricing report found that prices in 
the NW during the two months tracked the increased demand and supply 
shortfall.

Kurt,
I have attached the April Log with some corrections to the curtailments.  The 
lines I shaded blue are typing errors that I fixed.  These will account for 
the negative hours and the turbines with no data. 

 The turbines that are showing hours but no production must be a result of a 
SCADA data acquisition problem.  These entries I shaded in red.  I started 
looking through the list in the April Log but I could not find any errors on 
our side, so you may have to base the lost production on what a particular 
turbines' neighbor produced or lost.  

Call me if you have any questions.

Matt,
Please take a look at this as soon as possible this morning. It appears that 
you may have some entries where the operator used the 12 hour clock instead 
of th 24 hour clock. There are many rows where a turbine is curtailed but the 
way the time is recorded makes it come out with zero production. Call me if 
you need help.

Kurt,

I'm attaching the generated spreadsheet. There are a few problems. Scanning 
through it it appears the site personnel entered some times backwards so 
there were a few negative durations with 0 kWh predicted productions. I also 
do not know what is causing the other 0 kWh productions (it might be low 
wind, or there might be some other problem).

There was a 90.9% data recovery. The predicted production for the month was 
45929604 kWh, the production lost due to curtailment was 21780739 kWh which 
after 97% availability and 2% line loss becomes 20704770 kWh.

Due to the many curtailments at the site this program takes a lot of time 
(today it ran for 2 hours). 

Mark

Subject: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product

Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects 
which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of 
Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and 
maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to 
its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services 
offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of 
deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.  

Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would 
feature similar assets and services.
SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers 
that comprise each segment. 
The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific 
projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list 
represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried 
from PCCS.
The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related 
assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities 
have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, 
Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly.
Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption 
of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all 
assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real 
estate segment.





Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and 
Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation 
product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  
Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.

Thanks.

Richard

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

As requested, I investigated potential government approvals or potential 
political interventions if India assets/investments are sold.  My 
understanding from the India CFO (in response to my query about approvals 
necessary for any sell-down like we are working on for Dabhol) is that it 
depends to whom we sell.  If we sell to an Indian company, then the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) must approve taking dollars out of India.  If a sale is 
made outside India, no Indian approvals are necessary.  There are, however, 
many other approvals that would need to be obtained -- specifically from 
lenders and counterparties pursuant to project documents.  I have not 
analyzed these financial-related approvals."

Joes,

Thanks for the note.  My only comment would be in relation to the resource adequacy discussion - watch this one, I believe that NERC is trying to promote a nation-wide ICAP.

Kind Regards,

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the ""market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets."" He added: ""It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets."" 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity.

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, ""I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe."" 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,"" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. ""We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery."" 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. ""If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Dietert says. ""In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow."" 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, ""Why? Ask why."" 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  ""I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants"" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, ""and it's never
been in the news,"" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. ""My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion."" 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  ""Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,"" Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  ""I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance,"" Doot said. ""Those things have in fact
happened from time to time.""

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN
2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking ""non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,"" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

Now that the accrual book is fresh on your mind, I would like to propose the 
following for Schedule C prudency:

1)  Monetize $20 million of the 2001 accrual gas position to be utilized for 
the following Schedule C prudency accounts:

$10 million against the JEA (Northern Florida) short position (170,000 MWh's 
on-peak).   We have mid-marketers attempting to buy energy for 01 and 02 in 
FL, however, the market is extremely tight with no competitive offers.   The 
JEA position is covered with FPL non-firm power, therefore, we are exposed to 
on-peak price volatility due to FPL economic curtailment during load 
management periods.
$3 million against the VEPCO market-based call option with a look back audit 
on pricing.  This deal is an absolute pain in the ass because we are forced 
to quote a price to VEPCO that is representative of an actual transaction at 
reasonable prices with a rationale counterparty in the SE market.  They can 
call on the MW daily, weekly, or monthly.   We can lose as much as $2-3 
million/yr on this BS position due to the logistical issues and look back 
audit rights that VEPCO has.
$2 million against the MJMUC (inside Associated Electric Coop) 40 MW 7x24 
short position in a transmission constrained market area with absolutely no 
liquidity.  We have this position marked against the Entergy curves, however, 
physical delivery is a major issue which creates curtailment (and LD$) 
uncertainty.
$5 million against the OPPD 110 MW daily shaped call (with hourly 
flexibility) that is nearly impossible to hedge cleanly.   OPPD is in 
Southern MAPP (Nebraska) and delivery risks are significant.  The total deal 
is in our books at negative $25 million (10/2/00 curves) and we potentially 
have an additional $5 million of exposure due to illiquid nature of MAPP, 
scalar risk, and physical delivery risk.

We have several other customer deals that have hair, however, they are 
generally more manageable from a physical delivery standpoint.   Each of the 
deals above are in illiquid markets with delivery problems and scheduling 
flexibility for the counterparty that is incosistent with the current power 
trading market.   For these generic reasons and the specific issues outlined 
above, I am recommending Schedule C prudency for the amounts indicated 
above.  
From my standpoint, it is prudent and appropriate to use $20 million from gas 
accrual gains to finance these prudency positions.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks."

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian


All games are on Wednesday nights at Jaycee Park ballfield
9/6 8:30pm vs. Raiders
9/13 7:30pm vs. Jay Ballers
9/20 8:30pm vs. Organized Confusion

Mike signed on Friday which is great news.  Richter, Heizenrader, and I are all waiting on language that gets us comfortable with the California litigation risk.  In case you were wondering, we are not talking to one another about this language.  Each person is working independently on this.  We have been waiting on Michele Cash for a week now on proposed language (and for me, a copy of Enron's corporate bylaws explaining officer indemnification).  I will keep you posted."

It will be hard for me to make these meetings on time, since Dave's meeting often ends after 10 and he/Janet often do followup meetings right after.   If others have a similar problem, I would like to suggest reconsidering the afternoon or  Tuesday am slot.

	It has become necessary to change the starting time for our Monday morning staff meetings (Policy Committee and Office of the General Counsel) from 11:00 am CDT to 10:00 am CDT.  Also due to the time change, we will need to return to meeting in EB38C2.  

	The next Policy Committee meeting will be on Monday, August 27.

	Monday, September 3, is the Labor Day holiday; therefore, the next Office of the General Counsel meeting will be on Tuesday, September 4.

	The call in numbers have not changed.  

	Thank you.

With the U.S. dollar weaking over the last month vs. most major currencies, and forecasts for it to continue to do so, (which is clearly helpful to Enron while we try to sell international assets), I was wondering if we should think about selling some long dated (6 month-to 1 year depending on when we think we could actually sell something) OTC F/X or Euro calls.  (Or sell calls and buy puts with the proceeds.

Any thoughts?

Just got off the phone with Gail. She wants to know if they can help by coming up with a guaranteed offering from IBM that would help any NewCo succeed by providing IT support/direction, saving money, monetizing assets, retaining key staff and lending the IBM name, etc, etc to the deal.

If you're interested you can either call me or call her directly.

Regards

Mark Pickering

Anything here?  I think that at one time prior to filing IBM was looking to buy or monetize or loan against all out hardware so we could get cash but I am not sure where that went.

Mark,

As mentioned in our call on Tuesday, we have discussed with the US Embassy 
(State Dept) what we would like to see covered in the next round of the US 
Japan bilateral talks on deregulation in the energy sector. I attach a brief 
note which confirms in broad terms our preliminary discussions on the topic.

We are encouraging a significantly more cooperative approach by the US to 
Japan, particularly in the wake of the telecom talks earlier this year. As 
mentioned in the attached note, we believe that the Japanese Government 
genuinely wants to implement further reform, but is having difficulty in 
balancing competing policy interests. We are not advocating that the USG tell 
Japan what its environmental policy or energy policy should be. We are 
suggesting more of an advisory role. The concrete outcome would be further 
significant reforms to the electricity and gas sectors, together with a 
timetable for complete deregulation.

We have consciously stopped short of recommending a preferred structure for 
the electricity and gas sectors for a couple of reasons. Not only would it be 
inappropriate for the USG to dictate to the Japanese Government on what to do 
rather than how to do it, but determining the Enron preferred structure for 
Japan is a significant undertaking and something that we are currently 
working through. In this regard, as mentioned on Tuesday we will be looking 
for significant support from your group and clearly will need sign off from 
Europe and Houston. 

The approach we are recommending that the US Government adopts reflects the 
approach we propose adopting in Japan. To assist us in getting our message to 
the right people, we have been taking steps to further develop our 
relationships with cabinet ministers, the MITI Director General and others, 
including members of the following committees who are or will be reviewing 
various aspects of energy policy in Japan:
- the LDP Comprehensive Energy Policy Study Committee (Chair - Mr Amari) 
- the supra partisan New Energy Policy Committee ( Chair - former PM Mr 
Hashimoto)
- the business lead Deregulation Committee (Chair - Orix chairman Miyauchi)
- the MITI sponsored Liberalization of Power Industry and Public Interest 
Committee ( Comprising academics)

I would welcome your comments on the attached note.

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Summary of Oral Arguments and All-Party Meeting before the CPUC taking place 
on January 3, 2001: 

Oral Arguments were held at the CPUC today for purposes of commenting on 
today's draft final order.? The oral arguments were presided over by ALJ 
Walwyn.? The All-Party Meeting, which was presided over by Commissioner Wood, 
was not eventful.? Many of the participants left after the Oral Arguments and 
those who remained mostly responded to comments made during the Oral 
Arguments.? 

Both SCE and PG&E argued that the CPUC erroneously failed to address an end 
to the rate freeze, recovery of past undercollections, and right to recover 
their full future procurement costs.? Both also argued that the surcharge 
will be inadequate to satisfy the financial community.? In addition, SCE 
requested that the CPUC relieve it of the obligation to procure power for its 
customers which is priced above the amount that they can recover from their 
customers.? PG&E argued the proposal failed to provide certainty for recovery 
of costs and criticized the CPUC's focus on accounting arguing that changes 
to the accounting methods were not a solution. 

The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (CPUC Division) (""ORA"") suggested several 
additional solutions for the CPUC to consider as a final solution:? (1)? 
encourage the utilities to issue revenue bonds; (2) reduce utilities' return 
on equity by one-half; and (3) encourage energy conservation which addresses 
the alleged price gouging.? ORA also argued that the utility companies needed 
to do more to cut corporate costs.

The California Industrial Users (""CIU"") generally supported the proposal but 
criticized it for discriminating against larger customers and argued that the 
CPUC needs to look out for the welfare of all customers, not just smaller 
customers.? Both Reliant and Enron argued that the current situation is a 
short term problem and should be addressed with only interim relief.? Both 
also argued that the surcharge is not adequate and should be re-examined.? 
Enron complimented the CPUC on its decision not to lift the rate freeze.

The citizen advocates and consumer advocates (Greenlining Institute, Aglet 
Consumer Alliance, Golden State Power Cooperative, California Farm 
Federation) were generally satisfied with the proposed final decision.? They 
commended the CPUC for not lifting the rate freeze and for insisting on 
thorough and continuing investigations but argued the CPUC also needs to 
study the impact rate increases would have on the California economy, not 
just its affect on the utility companies.? TURN blamed the marketers and the 
utility companies for the crisis and argued that consumers shouldn't be 
forced to bail out the utility companies for their own bad decisions.? 

A private attorney from San Diego who filed a lawsuit against out of state 
generators to recover alleged windfall profits suggested the CPUC not grant a 
rate surcharge until the utility companies actually declared bankruptcy and 
argued that filing for bankruptcy could provide an incentive for the utility 
companies to press their case against the marketers.? Commissioner Wood 
however expressed concern about the implications of bankruptcy on labor 
contracts and QF contracts. 

Regards, 
Ed

Sherry/Errol:

I just got a request from Todd Lambert at EES to retroactively do a trade for 
expired months.  The details are:

EES sold NYMEX gas contracts to a customer named Springs Industry for futures 
months October, November, and December 2000.

However they were not supposed to sell to the customer directly at that 
point.  He wants to know if we can work out a deal where he instead sold 
those contracts to us and then have us sell to the customer.

There would be no net position and we would just serve as a pass through for 
their deal.

I'll come by later today to see if we can do it.

Tom,

Attached are the graphs for energy lost due to the pitch and overspeed faults 
you listed. As I mentioned before the methodology requires decent data 
recovery for the 10-minute data. The data recovery was poor for several sites 
in January, and for Fenner and Klondike in May. 

I will be compiling a report on this request, summarizing the graph types and 
some explanation of the methods used to produce them. I hope to have that 
completed within the next couple of days.

If you see deficiencies or suggested modifications let me know.

Mark

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

Subject: 

Now that we have implemented SAP, the BUs have come together to form teams to 
fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in 
the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.  Melissa Becker 
will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.

The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) 
and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 
to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.  
Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.  The teams will be gathering 
information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs 
and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as 
well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.

The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to:

1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities
A. Implement short term measures to address current ""hot"" reporting issues 
(e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is 
spearheading this effort.)
B. Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to 
information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access)
C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas 
(costs, P&L, counterparties and cash)
2. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information
A. Implement process changes required to execute reporting objectives
B. Shorten close process
C. Improve basic ""blocking & tackling"" related to controls 
D. Share best practices among BUs

Representatives from the BUs working on these two teams will be:

Steve Thatcher  ENA
Caroline Lothian Europe
Joe Darensbourg International regions
Howard Selzer  International regions
Steve Frazier  EES
Madeline Chan  EBS
Dave Wittenburg ETS
Jill Erwin  Corp Acctg and EGF

The following are subject matter experts (SMEs) in various BUs and functional 
groups who will spend varying amounts of their time in addressing specific 
issues.

James Weitekamp ETS (planning)
Sayed Khoja  EGM 
Allen Ueckert  International regions (project systems)
Glenn Kobes  Tax
Brandee Sanborn ISC

We will continue to identify others who will share their expertise.

The following people will be working specifically on data warehouse and 
web-based reporting initiatives:

Beverly Fennesey ISC 
Li Chan   ENA
Pat Cagney  EES

The teams will begin by interviewing persons identified by the CAO of each 
BU, to determine their information needs and to review their processes, while 
continuing to develop the data warehouse and creating the web-based reporting 
tool.  The efforts of the process leveraging and reporting teams are vital to 
our being able to quickly obtain key information to run our businesses.  I 
appreciate all of your efforts to date with regard to SAP and now, Project 
Sunrise.  The ultimate success of these efforts depends on all of us working 
together to learn to fully utilize and optimize the new tools we have 
available to us.  Thanks again for all your help.

Rick, Jim and Steve:

Please find attached a revise doutline for the policy paper on RTO
development.

A few things to note (to make sure you are truly OK with it):

- the ""base model"" described will basically be a ""PJM Light"" with
energy-only bids. This will involve a centralized unit commitment process
(based on a constrained optimization) and financial transmission rights. All
other items on the ""wish list"" will be treated as future potential
developments.

- there will a substantial section on market power issues and RTO
development.

- there will a section on the relationship between wholesale and retail
market development. The main idea is that a ""wholesale only"" market without
price signals sent to customers is not going to be viable.

- the main conclusion section will center on a ""100 days"" (not literally 100
days) set of policy proposals for getting workable markets established
across the country ASAP.

Comments welcome.

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan. ?See
Section 5 - A Japanese Pool. ?They make several good arguments as to why a
mandatory pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for
Japanese liberalization. ? Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US
policy arguments.

Billy,

I just wanted to thank you for your making the time to meet with me on Tuesday afternoon.  I appreciated your time and felt it gave me some useful information regarding the analyst program.  I believe the better understanding of the program that you provided will allow me to better manage and coordinate the activities of the analysts in the real-time group in Portland.  I do think a visit and information session later in the summer might be helpful as well.

Thank you again for your time and enjoy the holiday weekend.

I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two 
need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all 
payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet 
needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with: 
""Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither 
is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest.""  Also, the 
mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating 
service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor 
things:  in bullet 2, add an ""s"" to ""contract"" inline 2; in bullet 7, add 
""the"" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends
03/14/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Dave Kearns

NetWare has shipped with Btrieve (originally a flat-file database
system, now grown into a full-fledged relational database system) since
the days of NetWare 2 some 12 years ago. Many independent software
vendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications
to use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.

Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve
outright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of
the original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software.
Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of
""Pervasive SQL 2000,"" a true relational database system which
nevertheless still purports to support applications written to the
Btrieve 6.x specification.

A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no
longer an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still
uses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products
database (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1
includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000  enough for the
administrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any
Btrieve-based applications the network might be running.

There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an
evaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use
licenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software
vendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators
could be caught off-guard when applications stop working.

For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10
included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't
tested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and  the real
killer  most current applications (such as Computer Associates
ArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.

Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to
NetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the
requisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you
want to do, or if switching to a different application is the better
choice.

For those of you who might be working on LM6000 transactions, there is a 
rough cut of a standardized Financial Model and a old Capital Cost 
Configuration Model that you can use for current/future LM6000 projects. Both 
of them are saved as read-only at o:/naes/from_ko_LM6000/control. If you do 
not have access, please compose a Security Request via Lotus Notes.

Please note that there are still work to be done on both models. If you are 
assigned with any LM6000 models, please keep me in the loop, and I can fill 
you in on the model progress and process. 

Thanks.

Jeff,

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd 
been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential 
use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a ""rectangular""
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

FYI.  The email below changes things for years 4 & 5 because we would need to 
have gas for the summer months.

Charlie - please proceed with getting the pricing as we talked about, but 
also try to get pricing for more of a firm service (instead of best efforts) 
for Summer '05 and '06.  What is the gas availability outlook for this time 
period?

Thanks.

Nick:

I wanted to check with you on one issue on the Midway pricing request 
currently at the desk.

The interruptible provision should be for the following profile:

 Years 1, 2, & 3 1,000 hours per year
 Years 4 &5 500 hours per year

This is the profile of allowed oil back-up operation under the project's air 
permit.

Is this profile consistent with the pricing request we discussed with Charlie 
yesterday afternoon?

Let me know.  I wanted to check this before they give us pricing back.

Hi Susan,

Not to make a nuisance out of myself.  But it is extremely important that we 
pick up the missing the Gas Daily Deals.  There are 8 missing deals from 
March 28 and 26 missing deals from yesterday.  This throws our deal count, 
volume and value off for the upper management report that people like Louise, 
Sally Beck and Skilling see everyday.  Attached are the 26 deals from 
yesterday.  I need to know which officialized Post Id that they are in.

Please get back to me as soon as possible.  I will appreciate any help you 
can give.

I have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response. 
There are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term ""take away rights"", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a ""single bus"" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.

Each participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.

The ""single bus"" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.

""For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission 
involved) use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the 
first line and the words ""Single Bus"" in the OASIS reservation field and 
""7-F"" as the Product."" 

Is this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID 
Columbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C 
are have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a ""TP 
specific transmission path or designation"".  It was agreed to use ""Single 
Bus"" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service 
where no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. 

If the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that 
point then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for 
their transmission portion, but may be ""GF"" or ""No reservation required"" 
from the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not 
MIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in?

I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval 
from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is 
to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an 
archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at 
sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please 
have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and 
allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only 
last 3-4 hours.  

Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal 
once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that 
under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural 
resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review 
the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt 
think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back 
logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on.

The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might 
require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
you know when I find out something..........  "

Electricity deregulation brings on crisis in California

From: Petrostrategies --

California's power generators blame the 'rigid nature' of the deregulated 
energy sector for the prevailing electricity crisis, which has seen wholesale 
power prices jump by as much as $500/Mwhr from $150/Mwhr in summer 1999 even 
as retail prices have been frozen until March 2002. Meanwhile, since demand 
has grown by a mere 3% from mid-1999, some consumers fear that the crisis has 
arisen, not from Californian deregulation, but from power generators who are 
taking advantage of the crisis to earn more. Tasked to act on the problem, 
FERC is to announce the results of its probe on the energy crisis by 
11/1/2000.

know the details.  The agency is something like Vitol.  I suspect Claudette

Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 
2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at

Vince I thought this resume might be of interest to you.  Alan Lambert is a 
personal friend of mine.  However, rather than put him onto you, I thought 
I'd send this by you first.  If you have interest please feel free to contact 
Alan directly.  If there are others you'd recommend me sending this by, 
please let me know.  If neither, please let me know so I can tell Alan its 
just not a fit.

                  Marketplace Meditations
                       by Os Hillman

Horizontal Versus Vertical

Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the
Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
- (Exodus 2:12)


Moses saw the pain of his people. He saw the bondage and the
injustice. His heart was enraged, and he decided he would do
something. He would take matters into his own hands. The result
was murder. The motive was right, but the action was wrong. He
went horizontal instead of vertical with God. The action was
wrong. Moses fled to the desert, where God prepared the man who
would ultimately be the deliverer of a nation. But it took 40
years of preparation before God determined Moses was ready. He
was a professional businessman-a sheepherder. It was during the
mundane activity of work that God called on him to be a
deliverer.

Moses was like a lot of enthusiastic Christian businesspeople who
seek to solve a spiritual problem with a fleshly answer. The
greatest danger to the Christian businessperson is his greatest
strength-his business acumen and expertise to get things done.
This self-reliance can become our greatest weakness when it comes
to moving in the spiritual realm. We're taught to be problem
solvers. But, like Moses, if our enthusiasm and passion are not
harnessed by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will fail
miserably. Peter had to learn this lesson too. His enthusiasm got
him into a lot of trouble. But God was patient, just as He is
patient with each of us. Sometimes He must put us in the desert
for a time in order to season us so that Christ is allowed to
reign supreme in the process.

Before you act, pray and seek the mind of Christ until you know
it is God behind the action. Check it out with others. You may
save yourself a trip to the desert.

He is a hands on person with wide range of experience ( energy financing, 
derivatives trading, hedging, etc).
He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering & 
modeling.

I think my 9 - year old daughter could have written the attached white paper. 

 Listed below are the members of the pro-synfuel lobby group.  They would 
like us to join as well.  Not sure what we gain - any ideas?

Last week I sent copies of the product description and GTC to Becky Cantrell 
(regulatory) for comments and she did make a couple of suggestions which I 
agree with.  First, in both the description and the original GTC we refer to 
an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would 
not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have 
some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove 
the words ""or open season"" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, 
since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open 
season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

The other question she had is how we would define the following terms and how 
they would be made a part of the contract:  Reference Pipeline, Rate 
Schedule, Primary Receipt and Delivery Point.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this.

     Dan & Steve,
     
        This meeting is scheduled to be held on Friday 1 December at 
     McDonalds Headquarters in just outside of Chicago. People are flying 
     in Thursday night and we plan to go through most of Friday - maybe 
     with a tour of Hamburger University. The participants are General 
     Motors, Dupont, McDonalds, NASA, and hopefully Enron. I will be 
     traveling on Tuesday, but could we arrange a time to discuss this on 
     Wednesday?

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO

Harry:  FYI.  First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by 
AB 970 is 10.7.  Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from 
EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office).  
Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.  URL for the 
event is included below.

Best,

I am pulling together an answer to Larry Derrett's question concerning tax 
credits/deductions to incent companies to invest in DSM.  Am aware of recent 
California SB 970 that makes available $50 million to implement 
cost-effective energy conservation and demand-side management programs.  And 
of course there are lots of utility-specific programs that have been in place 
for a while.

Question - are you aware of any new initiatives, federal, state, or 
otherwise, that are being proposed?  Are you engaged anywhere in proposing 
such things?  Thank you.

Rick,
Could you give Larry Derrett a brief update on his question.  
Since many people in EES are asking a similar question, I'll copy Peggy 
Mahoney and ask her to use your answer as the source for communicating this 
to our employees via the BUZZ, our weekly newsletter.

Given the current political climate and concerns about adequacy of energy 
supplies, is someone at EES lobbying with politicians for certain 
arrangements which could be beneficial to our business?  For example, would 
there be interest in creating a tax credit/favorable deduction to incent 
companies to invest in DSM assets to reduce energy consumption?  I can't 
imagine that the political climate could be any better than now for a program 
like this.

That sounds like a good one, mom. Like I've said before, I think it's a great 
idea and would be perfect for you. Now I think you should start taking steps 
to make it happen. I know you could get your house sold, no problem. And you 
should think seriously about putting it on the market soon, as I'm starting 
to get the feeling it can take quite a while to actually sell a house. Let me 
know how I can help - for example, Brian has some friends who rent out a 
great cottage in Kihei for $100 a week. He can also get really good deals on 
rental cars. If you start shopping around for a cheap ticket now, you could 
take a scouting trip this spring and make plans to move by the following 
winter - just in time for whale-watching. 

Just do it!"

Louise, about the conference for this month in Mexico. The agenda is set for the 19th in Monterrey and the 20 th in Mexico City.

We are ready to send out invitations, to around 550 customers via email. I believe the response rate to it, could be from 140 to 250 people.
The variable budget then, would be anywhere between $14,000 to $20,000, depending in the amount of material we will need to print, but we'll play it by ear and react as confirmations arrive. Costs include Room reservation, printed material, translation, and 1 hour of cocktails for our customers after each conference. 

Conferences will be held in the two ""Industrial's Club"", which are some of the best places in such cities. 

This is already included in this year's budget, but I wanted to let you know. 

Attached you will find the Invitation, and I included you in the Agenda to give the welcoming remarks to our customers. Let me know if it is OK with you, before sending it out.

 

Best regards.

The Mineral Leasing Act may be the statute that governs--at least I'm 
familiar with it as the statute governing the MMS onshore oil and gas royalty 
program.  There are also statutes that cover hard rock mining rights and 
surface (i.e., grazing) rights.  I'm not sure which one is the basis for 
Greg's theories.   What you guys need is a real dirt lawyer.  Don't we have 
any ex-EOG lawyers around?  There aren't any in ETS that I'm aware of that 
know this stuff.  As to the RFP process, I have even less of an idea.  I hear 
you on your instinct to give him the answer, but one of my goals is to hear 
what MMS thinks its legal basis is for going after storage and forming my own 
view of whether they are right or just blowing smoke.  DF

I am doing some research on statutory authority to try to understand where 
the 12.5% comes from.

Drew,

Any thoughts on where I might go to find out more about the MMS RFP process 
because , if we understand it, we may be able to find a loophole.

I figure if we tell Greg what the answer is, he may be willing to accept it 
as opposed to us asking him to find the answer and relying on his 
interpretation

Debra, as we discussed, here is credit assurances language that Select
proposes to add to the Firm GTC, in addition to the other changes requested
by Select on 10/15/01.

Credit Assurances.  If either party (Party A) has reasonable grounds to
believe that the other party's (Party B) creditworthiness or performance
under this Firm GTC has become unsatisfactory, Party A will provide Party B
with written notice requesting Performance Assurance in an amount
determined by Party A in a commercially reasonable manner.  Upon receipt of
such notice Party B shall have three (3) Business Days to remedy the
situation by providing such Performance Assurance to Party A.  In the event
that Party B fails to provide such Performance Assurance, or a guaranty or
other credit assurance acceptable to Party A within three (3) Business Days
of receipt of notice, then an Event of Default  will be deemed to have
occurred and Party A will be entitled to the remedies set forth in Section
3 of this Firm GTC."

John,

Does anyone report to you the EES-CAL positions? As of this morning, that book was screwed up, for example, it included the Nepool positions. Is P&L of $20.5 MM as of 1/30 correct? Also, no VaR is reported on these positions as of this morning.

I am going to try to clean this mess up today.

Steve, here is the contact list that you requested.  By NO means is this a complete list, as I was not able to get hold of everyone in our group.  Christie will be back tomorrow and will add/delete/amend accordingly.  Mike will provide you with phone numbers for U of C, Northwestern, LSU, UT.
 
As an aside, I believe the general consensus from my counterparts is the most beneficial route to take would be to allow those who already have an existing personal relationship with key faculty and deans to be at the forefront of any contact and/or communications.  Enron's credibility has been very publicly damaged by a few of Enron's key executives and schools are reluctant to have discussions with someone from our camp whom they don't already know.
 
Hope this document helps in the interim.
 
Regards,
 
Cindy

Attached is another draft of the agenda for the meeting.  I added one item
of concern to PG&E having to do with the unfortunate financial problem of
your parent.

I have also attached in advance of the meeting the latest budget information
covering 2001.  I hope to send you the projected 2002 budget data on Monday.


It looks like we will have five attendees with only one able to play golf
(that being me).

We will see you on Tuesday evening at 7:00 pm in the lobby.  Hope everyone
will have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

I know that this is probably not as sophisticated as the chart tracking feature in PGAS described below, but I have talked with a couple of people in GMS and in PGAS under Report/Utility/List Contents you can find reports that are titled Nov Late Chart List/Utilicorp and also Dec Late Chart List/All NNG North End Late Charts, just to name a couple.  It sounds like these reports are done manually, in that each meter station has to be entered into this report.  Just thought that I would pass this along in case this report could be of some help to someone.

Thanks,

Raetta

Pursuant to our conversation yesterday, I have had discussions with Caroline Barnes and Gary Anderson in GMS concerning late charts for the month of December. GMS views a late chart as a chart that is not in their possession by COB on the 3rd working day of the month.   In further discussions with the GSM employees and Gary Anderson it was confirmed that they do not have any idea how many charts were late for the December close.  They also cannot produce a report reflecting when charts were received.

The PGAS program can has a chart tracking feature that requires each chart to have a bar code label and that GMS read the bar code when charts are received. Use of this process for all charts and index cards would provide a report of those charts that are late.  Two reports could be generated, one at COB on the third business day of each month and again as a part of the final close.  This process would tell us monthly where we have issues but to date it apparently has not been used. 

I have requested that Gary Anderson, for January business, provide through the PGAS report or other means a report by customer of the late charts.  These would be the charts that should be in the hands of GMS by the close of business on February 5.  This report should provide us with an idea of where we stand in respect to the late chart issue.  We will also request that GMS to mandate the use of the PGAS report to track receipt of charts going forward even after we have initiated the new mailing process.  We will monitor this activity on a monthly basis until we get comfortable with the process.

Charlie has indicated that the overnight mail process should be in progress by the first of March.  Charlie will follow up on the other issues discussed.

If you have questions, please advise.

Don

Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms 


(Published April 4, 2001) 
There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that 
envelops California's energy crisis. 
Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control 
and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer 
blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's 
utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are 
scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals 
for blame. 
No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very 
apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with 
energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the 
hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special 
committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis 
have gone into semihibernation. 
Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears 
that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will 
backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell 
warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for 
perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be 
accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said. 
Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a 
second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined 
sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his 
actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this 
problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans. 
Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape 
from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses 
in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of 
mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill 
Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis 
Davis. 
The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every 
sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled 
""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's 
apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. 
The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power 
purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into 
a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The 
long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases 
have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for 
them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. 
Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase 
market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a 
deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. 
Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the 
state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall 
Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power 
generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission 
grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. 
The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the 
specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air 
conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. 
Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With 
Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to 
protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

Tax:
The Enron entity executing the FX transaction as principal is ENA. 

However, note that for tax/legal the FX desk in London is run by Enron Europe 
Finance & Trading Limited (""EEFT"") as agent for ENA. Our position is that ENA 
does not have a place of business in London. Therefore all the transactions 
managed by the London FX desk are arranged by EEFT as agent for ENA.

Because of this there is a need to identify which FX desk arranged the 
transaction and a possible solution to this is to have separate logins and 
logoffs for each FX desk during their hours of responsibility. This would 
enable transaction reports to be run which identify those transactions which 
took place during the period for which each FX desk was responsible for 
managing the FX positions.

I have been told by the FX group here in Houston that London traders are able 
to act on the behalf of the US FX Desk because the transactions they do are 
for hedging purposes only (no proprietary trading). For example, the FX 
transactions that are done by Trena McFarland in London are done on the 
behalf of our Houston office, so Houston books the transaction, manages the 
risk, and writes the Confirmation in the name of ENA.

This being the case, (i) can we apply the same logic on the internal FX 
transactions that will be managed by both the US and UK traders and have the 
transacting entity as ENA (ii) if we do does it gives us the necessary tax 
relief, or (iii) should we stick the Metals structure where the transactions 
are offered by Enron North America, acting through it's agent, Enron Europe 
Finance and Trading Limited. While this may be an Internal Only Product Type 
today, what effect, if any, would the choice of trading entities have on our 
ability to offer these Products externally.

Technology Issue:

David - Stuart has explained to me that the US FX Desk now views these 
currency exchange products as financial products. This is contrary to 
previous discussions where we felt that any currency exchange involving an 
Index would be considered financial, while any 'strict exchange' would be 
considered a physical transaction. The change is based on conversations 
Stuart has had with the Metals traders wherein they would like to see this 
exchange product as a financial product. If we accept this logic, (i) do I 
need to create a Deal Type for 'Par Forward Swap' for the first FX Index 
Product Type that we did as well as a 'Forward Swap' for these transactions, 
or is it acceptable to leave these both as swaps, and (ii) regardless of the 
Deal Type classification discussed in (i), I will need to create a new 
Product Type for the 'strict exchange' - either as a physical or financial 
product. Additionally, if I set this up as Financial Product, I have the 
Index attribute in the template to contend with, because there is no Index; 
and if I set this up as a Physical Product, I have the Location attribute to 
contend with, because there is no Location. Naturally we can put something 
cheesy in to fill the gap since it's internal, but if we ever decide to go 
external we will need a new template - and from experience with the PJM Power 
(Weather Desk) Product Type, templates requires an 'and if' statement are 
hard to develop.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

Richard,

Please, let me know what the timetable is. I would like to talk to Anjam a

to break the news to him. I hope I can save him for the company and offer him 
a position in Houston.
We desperately need skills he has.

I propose accelerating Steve's move to head the Research group here.  It

Thoughts?

Vince - I agree with your conclusion here.  We are still trying to fill 
Dale's structuring role as well so part of the question is 
how we announce Steve's lead research role relative to when we know who will 
take Dale's spot.  Perhaps we should just
move forward with the Steve announcement the day that Dale moves full time to 
EBS.  I will ask Richard Lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes 
to the organization.

But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have Steve here.  He is a 
wonderfull asset to our efforts.

Thanks!

Subject: London Research Group

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

=09=09 Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 20=
01


The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=
.

Thank you.

Subject: For Discussion: Implementing Definition of Trading Office

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?

Attached is the latest markup on the warranty language which GE is now 
reviewing.  I also have a few comments from John Rigby which may be worth 
adding but I suggest we hold off until we discuss the warranty language with 
GE next week.

I also spoke to Steve Swift who indicated that he would Email to Sheila what 
has been agreed to on indemnity, LOL, ect. and what we intend to insert into 
the Arcos contract.  FYI I do not intend to use the ""end world hunger"" 
warranty language in the Arcos contract as I want GE back-to-back on what we 
have signed up to with the owner under the EPC contract.

Regards,

Scott

industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

Stinson and Vince,

I finalized the presentation for John Lavorato, he said he is ready
to present it  to Greg.  He is happy with the work we provided.


I will be on vocation starting next week.  I attached the simulation models
here in case that you need them.  The OC version deals with open-close
trading and CC version deals with continuous trading.


Should you have any questions, or need to run different scenarios, please
call me at home.  Otherwise, I will see you next year.


Merry Chrismas and Happy New Year !

Zimin

You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a 
year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I 
must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as 
they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited 
to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c 
anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm 
actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One 
of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it 
should be a nice 20 hour day today. 

I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need 
something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can 
find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm 
tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and 
give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  

Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that 
has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty 
funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  

Enjoy a doughnut for me.
Robin

Dear Ms.Feldman,
Please receive all my apologies for not having
answered earlier your 2 emails,but I was in the
States for 6 weeks and could not access my
Dauphine email.In any case,the time was
fruitfully used by my associates and myself to
improve the ""robustness"" of the product,from
a computer and mathematical standpoint.
Regarding your 3 points
1.We agree on the price of 90,000 USD
2.D-G will provide system support:we can do so
by emailing anther version of the software,being
available on the phone and by email but we
cannot promise unlimited support of all kinds
without risking bankruptcy right away.
Moreover,the $ 90,000 may be paid in 3 fractions
and your risk would be quite minimal
3.Regarding the escrow,we have been using so
far a small law firm with 5 partners(none of my
family) in Amherst:Hart,Reed,Brown,Golowich
and Kaplan.But we are not closed to anther
solution you would strongly prefer.
Best regards
Helyette Geman,PhD,PhD

Since NUI Utilites, Inc. is the rated entity, we are no longer requiring the 
$50MM NUI Corp gty for this transaction.  However, the financial swap (which 
should be 40,000/day total for May-Oct) is being documented under  the NUI 
Energy Brokers, Inc. existing ISDA.  Sara has modified to cross default the 
confirmation to the Credit Agreement.  Stacy, please share the language you 
are using for the Transaciton Agreement to compensate for the Credit 
Agreement expiry in December with Sara so the financial confirmation can be 
modified as well.  We also need to modify the financial confirmation to state 
that for this transaction only, NUI must be the Guarantor not NUI Capital.  
Then we must get a deal specific gty from NUI Utilites to cover this trade - 
probably $10MM.  This all arises because the finc/phys gty we were working on 
is out the window since NUI Utilities is the rated entity with associated 
balance sheet and the NUI Corp is not needed.  Please advise asap and call 
with any questions.

Thanks,

Subject: Goldendale


Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick.

Andy:

Please review the comments below.  As I stated in our meeting on Friday, I
have been pushing our team for the February 16th deadline.  Unfortunately,
there are some issues that have not been resolved and may be putting our
deadline in jeopardy.  I wanted you to review this summary of the current
state of affairs and compare it to your team's opinion on the situation.
Again, this is Maria's view of the situation, which might be totally
different from your team's perspective.  We do not want the situation to
become an ""us v. them"" mentality, so I am taking this opportunity to solicit
your feedback.  Dennis and I are hoping we can work diligently to make up
this time and resolve these issues in a joint effort.  We look forward to
your comments and completing this link once and for all.

Please let me know if I can provide any other input.

Best Regards,
Chris

Subject: Concerns with Status of Enron Integration Testing


Chris,

Dennis asked that I send you a note expressing our concern with the delays
that we have been experiencing with the Enron Integration testing.

We have essentially not made any progress since we began testing ""Enron
Posting Prices to True Quote"" on January 17th.  First, the test did not work
because there was a problem at Enron with price updates not posting
correctly to their integration server.  This problem was resolved and we
were asked to repeat the test a week later on January 24th.  This test was
also unsuccessful because the data we received did not contain any spaces
between words.  As of today, it has not been determined whether the problem
is on Enron's side or ours.  We have been continuing to research the problem
on our side and so far it looks to us like the data is arriving on our
server without the spaces. Enron's Operations group was planning to do a
test today to ""sniff"" the network to determine how the data is actually
leaving their firewall, but they have had other problems that have prevented
them from working with us today.  Last Friday they were not able to spend
any time working with us because they were getting ready for their
maintenance window.

Our concern is that each time we have encountered a problem, it has taken
several days to resolve the issue before we can move on to the next series
of tests.  Understanding that the due date is only 3 weeks away, the True
Quote team is concerned that Enron is not providing enough resources to work
the problems immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.  Part of
the reason for some of the delay on Enron's side may be that the group that
is involved in the testing has had to go back to the developer group for
assistance each time they have encountered a problem (at least that's our
understanding).  We don't believe that there is anyone in the developer
group that is dedicated to resolve our problems as soon as one is reported.

The reality of this situation is that we have one project but many different
disconnected teams working on the project.  As we move forward we would like
to make the following recommendations to improve the speed of our testing
activities:

1) Rather than working as two disconnected teams (testing via conference
call), it would be helpful if we had an Enron person here in our office each
time we test and communicate back to Enron the results that we are getting.
That person should be someone that has a direct link back to the developers
group, the operations group, and the products group.

2) The Enron resource should have as their priority to work with the
necessary groups within Enron to resolve issues as quickly as possible.

3) The developers group needs to address problems that are reported by the
testers as quickly as possible.

We welcome any other suggestions that you or Andy have to improve the speed
of our testing and implementation process.  Please let me know once you've
had a chance to speak to Andy if there is anything that he can do to provide
us resources to proceed with our testing more expeditiously.

Regards,

Notice No. 00-387
November 9, 2000

TO:  NYMEX Division Members

FROM:  The Board of Directors

RE:  Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan


As you have been previously advised, on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 the
Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York
Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan (the Plan)
conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter
Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchange's pending
demutualization plan.  On October 17, 2000, the Exchange held an open
members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer
any questions.  At the meeting, a number of members requested that the
Board review its decision to use the 8.5% discount rate recommended by
Deloitte & Touche in connection with termination of the Plan.  At the
members meeting, it was agreed that the Board would review the
discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting.

Following the members meeting, the Exchange obtained two additional
professional opinions from actuaries.  One opinion stated that the
appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating
the Plan should be between 7.8% and 8.1% and recommended using a
discount rate of 8.0%.  The third opinion recommended that the
appropriate range should be between 7.47% and 8.32% depending upon
various credit and other related actuarial issues.  Each of the
actuaries (including Deloitte & Touche) attended the Board meeting on
November 2, 2000 to present the rationale in support of their
respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by
members of the Board.

The Board was advised by the Exchange's General Counsel, as well as by
two independent outside counsels, that in order to avoid even the
appearance of a conflict of interest, the Board should delegate
authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of
Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan.  The
Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of
its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount
rate to a special committee (the Committee) composed of five Directors
who did not have an interest in the Plan.

After the Board formed the Committee, the members of the Committee,
the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the
matter privately.  After thoroughly reviewing the matter, the
Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the
appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the
termination of the Plan is 8.0%.

On October 23, 2000, the Exchange received a satisfactory Private
Letter Ruling from the IRS.  At its meeting on November 2, 2000, the
Board set a target closing date of November 15, 2000 for the
demutualization transaction.

Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the
closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan
through December 31, 2000.  All other rules regarding eligibility and
continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Plan.

Under the terms of the Plan, in the event of termination, Qualified
Participants (i.e. those participants with at least 15 years of
Continuous Service, as defined in the Plan) are entitled to a payout
equal to the net present value (NPV) of the scheduled ten-year benefit
payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not
terminated, to the extent of the assets held in trust for this
purpose.  If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment
to the Qualified Participants, those remaining assets are to be
distributed to participants with Continuous Service (as defined in the
Plan) between 10 years and 14 years.  These 10 - 14 year participants
are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have
received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement
age; the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of
Continuous Service and the denominator is 15.  If there are not
sufficient assets to pay each 10 -14 year participant their calculated
sums, then each 10 - 14 year participant will receive a pro rata
distribution.  These 10 - 14 year  participants must be members of
record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be
eligible to receive any distribution.

The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent
considerations with its actuaries, and all preliminary calculations
should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the
results of that review.  At this time, the Board believes that there
are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her
lump-sum benefit, based upon the approved a discount rate of 8.0%.  At
this time, it appears that after making payments to Qualified
Participants, the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro
rata benefits to 10 - 14 year participants.  10 - 14 year participants
can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the
NPV benefit of their corresponding age (see attached Schedule) by the
fraction of their whole years of service (10/15, 11/15, 12/15, 13/15,
or 14/15) by twenty-six (26%) (which at this time appears to be the
approximate  percentage of ""remaining assets"" available compared to
the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated).

Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received
their last quarterly payment in October 2000.  Remaining obligations
to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other
Qualified Participants.

It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure
will be made in mid-January 2001.

As of December 31, 2000 it is expected that total Plan assets will be
approximately $33.5 million.  Regardless of the discount rate used,
100% of the assets of the Plan will be distributed.  Using a discount
rate of 8.0% the Qualified Participants will receive approximately $30
million or ninety percent (90%) of the total Plan assets and 10 - 14
year participants will receive the balance.

For illustrative purposes, and subject to the conditions noted above,
the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated
lump-sum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age
indicated (but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits) as
of December 31, 2000.

In the event that any member has any questions in connection with
termination of the Plan, please contact Chris Bowen at 299-2200 or
Suellen Galish at 299-2215.  Copies of  both the original and amended
Plans are available.

Separate But Related Matter

Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by
others, neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor
the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments.  In
accordance with Section 8 of the original Plan, in 1997 the amended
Plan was approved by a three fourths (3/4) vote of the Board.  Section
8 of both the original and amended Plan provides that ""the Board of
Directors of NYMEX may at anytime, amend or terminate this Plan in
whole or in part, upon the affirmative vote of three fourths (3/4) of
the entire Board"".  Section 8 of the Plan further specifically
describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of
termination.  Section 8(C) (1) states that the net present value of
lump sum termination payments shall be ""calculated by using the
applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole
discretion, in good faith, and such determination shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties"".  Section 11, entitled Authorization of
the Plan and which remains unchanged  from the original Plan, only
applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in
1990.

Again, contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made, neither
the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific 
discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV.  In fact, the estates 
of two deceased former members
(Mel Miller and Leon Grappel) that erroneously have been reported to
have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of 6.0%
actually received payments based upon discount rates of  7.4% (paid in
1992) and 7.2% (paid in 1993), respectively.

Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we
are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution.

I have talked twice to Althea.  Once last week and once after your email this 
morning.  She has told me both times that she would arrange with Shirley to 
put Rusty on your schedule and on mine.

Subject: recommendation of an outstanding Baylor MBA student for summer  
internship


Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the 
birthdays simple.  "

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Rick,

You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov 14 with 
John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power 
Pool intended to implement in two days.  We developed a 5 point action plan 
to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a 
significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.    
By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the 
Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude 
importers from setting pool price.  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule 
changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron 
will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we 
should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of 
Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to 
encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will 
finalize our ""Lessons from other Jurisdictions"" document (that Steve sent me 
materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and 
Power Pool and then follow up with them.

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday.

Regards,

Rob

Good point on extra space.  Please call Wes Colwell and discuss.  I think 
that makes 33 less of an option.

Mike,

I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would 
also be good if there were a few extra
spots for some people in the group to be together.  I am not sure yet how 
many people will be needed but I would like
to optimally have a small swat team to focus on each business.  

Thanks very much for the kind words.  I look forward to focusing
on the new businesses quickly and figuring out ways to add value.  I am very 
excited to be working with you again.  Talk to you soon.

The charter party max is 1,080 mb absolute which is in our standing orders, 
the tariff max at CMS is 1112 mb absolute, and according to Ron Tanner the 
average they have been seeing is about 1160 mb absolute. For reference, we 
calculated that the ""LNG Jamal"" that we brought in on Feb 21 was at 1119 mb.  
Ron says that arrival pressure has not caused any delays at CMS so far, and 
that he does not expect us to have a problem or any delays even at as high as 
1160.  I would suggest we give orders to arrive no higher than 1160 to 
minimize boil-off, please let me know if this is acceptable and I will pass 
it on to the ship.

On the heel, we are not planning on making the decision until a few days 
before discharge so that we have the latest information on possible delays as 
well as bunker prices and such.  We did a calculation and came up with a 
figure of around $100,000 incentive to heel out and run bunkers on the 
ballast voyage as of today's numbers.  We will continue to monitor this as 
the discharge time gets closer.

Do we need to include in the orders that the arrival cargo saturation 
pressure not to exceed  1100mb ? ( whatever is TLNG's max. ). I believe the 
heel decision should wait until a few days before unloading to ensure before 
heel out we are sure we have a load window that will allow the extra time to 
cooldown again and we figure in the full cost to Enron of the cooldown LNG 
that would have to be purchased from OLNG.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Dear Vince,

	We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational
programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and
I discussed with you in the summer.  I am attaching (tentative) curricula
for two important programs: (1) A graduate certificate in Energy Finance,
(2) A 5-year BBA/MS program in Energy Finance.
	Briefly, the certificate is a 5-course for-credit program that is
available to people with sufficient basic background in finance, economics,
statistics and mathematics.  This certificate includes coursework in
accounting issues specific to the energy industry, basic aspects of energy
sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry, forecasting
and time-series econometric methodologies, basics of financial engineering
and derivatives, real-options and project analysis as it applies to the
energy industry, and energy derivatives and risk-managament.
	The 5-year program is more ambitious. It seeks to provide a broad
but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and
managers. In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in
math, probability and statistics, economics, chemistry and physics, and
accounting and finance. This is conceived to be an ""elite"" and highly
demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses
in a variety of areas.  The 5th or graduate year of the program is given
over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance
and accounting.
	I know you are extremely busy, but it would be very helpful to get
your reaction (even at a broad level) to these programs and the type of
courses that are envisaged.  We view these programs to potentially form the
core of the educational activities of the Institute, but the next step would
be to develop more specialized programs (of shorter duration) aimed at
professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry. We
are in the process of setting up the Institute and developing its governance
and administrative structure. I will give you more details very shortly.
	On another topic, Darrell Duffie (with whom I interacted with a lot
during our student days at Stanford) will be coming to present a seminar at
the Bauer College on January 10. We very much hope to see you and the Enron
group there.
	Finally, I hope that you and all of your loved ones and colleagues
are as well as possible in light of the recent tragedies. We can only hope,
pray and work to see that these senseless acts never again occur anywhere.


Best wishes,

Praveen

Dear Mr. Lay,

I am a former Enron employee who voluntarily resigned from Enron in August
of this year to spend more time with my two young children, Avery, 2 1/2 and
Nate, 17 months.  These past few weeks have been devasting for a lot of
people.  I personally have lost over $40,000 in my 401K which I was heavily
investing in Enron stock since my first day there, February 1998.  I also
lost all of my children's college funds, $10,000.  But, I am one of the
lucky ones, I know.

The reason for this note is just to say that I think very highly of you and
know what a GOOD person you are.  I was fortunate enough to have seen you on
the Crystal Cathedrial a while back, and I know that you are a caring
Christian man.  Thanks for all your efforts to save the company.

I just thought you'd like to hear some nice words from an employee rather
than all the trash from the media!

Sincerely,

Shelly Michalk"

ease?

Greetings:

Please review the attached.  It's a summary I've put together of a very=20
lengthy analysis MRW did for us over the weekend.  I've also attached the=
=20
considerably lengthier MRW memo for those who'd like to see it.  The tables=
=20
included in the summary are pulled directly from the MRW memo.  The analysi=
s=20
only addresses the utilities undercollection (i.e., solvency) and doesn't=
=20
address any additional increases that might result from DWR's buying=20
activities.

The Bottom Line
=06=15 By raising average rates 10% over a 10-year period, California could=
 1)=20
return the utilities to solvency, and 2) help close the  supply-demand gap =
by=20
providing customers with better price signals.
=06=15 California could achieve these goals under this new rate structure a=
nd at=20
the same time exclude one-third of residential  customers from any increase=
s.=20
If California chose not to exclude any customers from the new rate structur=
e,=20
California  would only need to raise average rates by about 8.8%.
=06=15 This level of increase is in line with increases enacted in other st=
ates=20
(e.g., Washington: 28-34%; Montana: 4.5-32%; Idaho:  6.0-24%; Nevada:=20
7-12.5%; New Mexico 12%).

We'll need to look at it critically and try to shoot holes in it before goi=
ng=20
public with the numbers as part of our broader effort, but it offers a=20
reasonable benchmark against which to judge alternatives (like spending the=
=20
kids lunch money on crumbling, broken down transmission systems).

Please provide feedback as soon as possible, and perhaps, Paul we conclude=
=20
the MRW work on the agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily conference ca=
ll.

Best,
Jeff

To Members of the RTO West Provisions and Requirements Content Group:

Hello!

Attached is an e-mail regarding California's New Facility
Interconnection Policy.  My thanks to Barney for sending this to my
attention!

Regarding the March 21st meeting -- I appreciate all of your responses
regarding the rescheduling request.  While some of you were amenable (in
fact it worked better for many of you), it was not doable for a
significant number of members, in particular some who had already made
their travel plans.  As such, we'll go ahead with the meeting as
original scheduled on the 21st.  My apologies to those of you who will
not be able to attend.

Thanks!  Kristi

        ISO Market Participants:
        The ISO has posted on its web site a white paper and draft
Tariff language regarding its proposed New Facility Interconnection Policy
(NFIP).  You can find these documents at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/05/200103051825008351.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/05/200103051825008351.html> . These
documents will be the basis of the stakeholder meeting scheduled for Monday,
March 19.
        If, as you review these documents, you have questions or
comments that you would like to have addressed on March 19th, please send
them to me and to Steve Greenleaf (sgreenleaf@caiso.com
<mailto:sgreenleaf@caiso.com> ) by close of business on Wednesday, March 14.
(In your e-mail, use ""NFIP Comments"" in the subject line.)  We will do our

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live
case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick

Karola Pearce (inhouse lawyer) just returned my call.  PG&E has created a NEW 
document (that is, we should ignore everything previously negotiated) and 
will FEDEX to us this week.  I hope we can negotiate the new document 
quickly.  Let me know if you have any questions. Sara "

Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is 
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried 
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community 
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each 
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the 
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, 
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is 
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.

I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon 
redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and 
currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't 
mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to 
you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing 
their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and 
being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you 
think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that 
we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy

Kathy,
Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern 
Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive 
Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian 
activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the 
Executive Committee.
Very truly yours,

Gentlemen,

Please take a moment to review the attached document that has been sent in
to the coordinator of the CFSA Tournament volunteers.  As you will see we
are still in need of a volunteer list from most of you.  For those of you
who have turned in your list, thank you very much, your prompt attention to
this request is greatly appreciated. I know Spring Break did not help
matters much but I need to get a completed list turned in ASAP. The longer
you wait the less of a chance you will have of getting your choice.
Remember CFSA is operated on a volunteer basis.  This means the organization
will only be as good as the people that volunteer.

Kay,

I got your email about the 1 month contract, and I hope you got a memo last 
Friday from John Brunini giving you our research to date. I may be in Houston 
next week (probably the 8th or 9th) and possibly again early the following 
week. Would it make sense for us to try to visit on this matter when I'm in 
town? If so, when might you be available?

Subject: RE: escrow instruction

Kay:

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on
the incumbency certificate that we previously submitted to Citibank (i.e.,
Thomas or Duran).  Can we change the signatory to Duran as opposed to
Calger?

(I suppose we have the same issue with PPL, as Vicens is not named on PPL's
incumbency certificate and Citibank already raised that issue for them on
the escrow agreement.  I will let Greg Lang know.)

Carolyn,

Please revised the signature page for escrow instruction to reflect Chris

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the ""Pulp & Paper P&L"", ""Pulp & Paper Position"", ""Pulp 
& Paper Price"", ""Emissions Summary"", and ""Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)"" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the ""Add-Ins available"" list, look for ""Websave.""  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a ""Websave2"" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Thanks Lee.  Never mind on the list, I didn't realize that they were deal specific.

your WHEREAS clause is fine.
We can develop a list but again it usually  only covers a specific transaction

I'll change the ""Transaction"" definition and the first WHEREAS to:

WHEREAS.....relating to the possible purchase by Transwestern of Company's weather derivative product (the ""Transaction"").  Is this okay?

When I was working on the VOD team at EBS, we talked with so many companies (as did other groups within EBS).  It was handy to know who was tied to us with a conf. agreement.  I thought it might be helpful here too.

You need to change the definition of Transaction in the first WHEREAS clause and then you can send it.

I could put together a list we have copies of them in the legal dept.  What do you want to use the list for??

Lee,

I made the changes to the Duke confidentiality agreement that you sent me, basically just the name changes.  Is there anything else I need to do, or can I just print this out and send it to them?  Please let me know.

Also,  Is there a list of companies that have a confientiality agreement with Transwestern?

 the SW. We also have a trough supplying cool air for the NW. This trough s=

Don, the duck hunting went great.  We bagged over 30 ducks (between 6 guys).  They were a combination of pintail, teal, buffalo head, and blue bills.  

The guides provide the dog, decoys, blinds, transportation, and they call them in for you.  They will let you call if you want, but the guides are top notch.

My uncle and I are thinking of going down this weekend or the next.  Let me know if you are interested, and we will reserve you a spot with us. 

Lyle

Lyle,

Thanks for the note.  How did the hunt go?  Did you have to bring decoys?  How did the guides do callin' in the ducks?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

Hi, 

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.  

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.  

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

Hey girl, what's going on?  When are you going to be here so I can clear my
schedule.  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late.  The
visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how to
use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church.
After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again.  So this tells all of
us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job.   The main concern that
is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the
vomiting.  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back over
there to hear what they have to say.  Daddy goes to the new doctors on May
31.  The main concern is the vomiting.  We just have to hang in there and
keep praying.  After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a hard
time dealing with it on Friday.  Everytime someone would ask me about it, I
would start crying.  I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed fine
last night.  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up to
him to talk with Corey.  The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's boss
and ask him about his retirement.  Even though he is eligible, he is not
ready to take that final step.  when junior and I were talking, we wondered
about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned) if he
does not officially retire?   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are.
It is very important that his attitude stays positive.  Enough for now.
Talk with you later.

Hey girl,

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So
little C.J. looks like a ""half-breed"", (that's what you''re trying to
say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena
yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop
trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he
will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to
concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to
seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and
fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was
hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding ""little
bitty"" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men ""showed out"".  However, the
concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several
acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15
p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton
Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates
again.

Talk with you later.

   How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your
   job.  I
   was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

   I saw ""little"" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some of
   his
   Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker
   than
   teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take some
   getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
   I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in
   when
   we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is
   the
   Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

   Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know
   you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a

   her
   to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned,
   we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams,
   etc.
   Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have
   dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so
   I'll
   try to call you on the way home.

Beta Thursday Night Gang,

Significant progress has been made in our quest to locate an alternate
venue for our Thursday night rendezvous.

The suggestion actually came from Queensbury, NY of all places.  Yes,
brother Rob Rossell ('77) has volunteered his brother Bill's
establishment....Lakewood Landing.  Tom Benson says it's near Stan's Blue
Note Inn.

A brief description, details and directions will follow.

I spoke to Mike Arends today...it looks like Mike will be joining us in
spite of the fact that he will be at the alter 2 weeks later.  Rob
Rossell tells me that Tim Strange is coming down with Harry Singleton.
The brothers just keep on coming out of the woodwork.  Rob Bugh got into
the loop only recently- too late to make plans to leave the flock behind.

Though he's become a silver-gray, his hand keeps time and measure...check
out Elvis doin' the hambone thing (attachment).  A Beta Top 40 included
too! (don't worry Jansson, I still have my day job)

We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.

I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.

Thanks.

Kevin 

As I mentioned to you, due to some recent success in obtaining additional security, we are extending credit to Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only.  We will not be granting them execution rights on EOL due to the lack of controls/functionality for daily transactions.  EOL, unlike ICE, has tenor function set by months versus number of days.  As a result, in the case of Edison Mission, if we set EOL for one month, Edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month.  It seems to make this work for Edison and perhaps other potential counterparties, it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions.  If you would like to discuss further, please call.

All:

As some of you may be aware, we appear to be getting close to entering a transaction with NSTAR to serve its all-requirements power needs for its Residential and Commercial customer class Default Service obligations.  The deal would be for a term of 6 or 12 months commencing July 1, 2001.  NSTAR's service territory covers Boston and surrounds, as well as south-eastern Massachusetts.  This prospective deal is very similar in nature to the Standard Offer Service deals we have entered into with United Illuminating, NSTAR, and most recently, Central Maine Power.

Here is the status at this point:
NSTAR achieved various levels of signoff for the basic deal structure (both with regulators and internal senior management).  NSTAR has indicated that it has basically come down to price and they could potentially pull the trigger as early as Monday, but certainly within a couple of days at the most.
NSTAR has requested updated pricing by 10 AM Eastern on Monday 3/26 to be held firm through COB same day (contingent upon execution of definitive agreements by that time).  They are seeking pricing updates from competing suppliers so we are not exclusive at this point.
NSTAR/Enron have worked through our extensive markups on their proposed contract, and have compiled a list of outstanding contract issues. (Note: Marcus Nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal, and can be reached at 5-8161 to discuss contract issues).   While the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point, my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours.  In fact, they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for Standard Offer Service, so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay, thereby potentially making execution on Monday a possibility.

Attached is a draft DASH for this deal .  I request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid-afternoon on Monday so as to enable us to transact on Monday if necessary.  The parameters that are still in motion are:  (1) price (again to e updated Monday morning), but will maintain same NPV value; (2) term (they may end up just going for 6 months); and (3) exact volume they source from us.  As for volume, they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than 100% of their requirements for the first 6 months (they estimate anywhere between 50-100%), and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second 6 months if they do end up doing a 12-month deal.  

Please feel free to call me (978-449-9936 office, 978-448-9260 home over the weekend) if you would like to discuss in more detail.   Berney Aucoin in Structuring will be on point to run internal traps on Monday as may be necessary.  Thanks in advance.

Regards
John

You asked about:  James W. Cunningham, General Manager - Bellingham 
Operations, Georgia-Pacific Corporation.  

As I understand it, GP is currently served under Schedule 48 by Puget Sound 
Energy.  
Schedule 48 prices the energy component of a customer's rate on the basis of 
an index (I can't recall if its Dow-Jones or NYMEX).  
This summer GP complained about the high prices under the rate schedule and 
accused PSE of improperly implementing the rate schedule.  
While the basic problem was the high prices resulting from application of the 
index, GP nonetheless filed a complaint against PSE at the WUTC.  

GP is advised by Robert McCullough.  Recall that McCullough has issued press 
reports indicating that the capacity shortage 
is a result more of game playing than anyting else.  

I think you can expect Cunningham to be slightly hostile (not so much to 
Enron, but rather to open markets in general)--in this regard he may be an 
advocate for WSCC-wide caps and may argue that there was gameplaying in the 
PNW (which produced high off-peak prices and and a June peak price of about 
$1500 MWh.  
Re:  Enron, Greg Wolfe tells me that ENA
mid-market made several offers through PSE and a variety of consultants to 
try and help GP.  I don't believe any of the offers were accepted.

If Cunningham is speaking for more than just GP--i.e., ICNU as a whole, we 
can expect a slightly softer approach.  Perhaps:  (1) resources are good; (2) 
a WSCC wide cap is appropraite in the near term; (3) a transition to 
restructuring  is appropriate.

From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties."

Hi Dave.  As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg 
will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8).  See how that looks on 
the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland.  (I did go to 
the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat 
my group gave me--pictures to follow)
Can you believe I went to the Rodeo?

Below is slightly revised language to be included in the ISDA agreement being 
entered into in connection with the EEX transaction.  Not having the 
transaction documentation to review in connection with this clause, I have 
bracketed several portions of the clause to be filled in as dictated by such 
documentation.  Please call with any follow up.  Steve.

Subject: Language for the Confirmation

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
""Enron Re:"" is the U.S. entity and ""Swiss RE - EFR"" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by [Enron Re] of the [Floating - this assumes that Enron Re is paying 
such amount] Amount will be treated as a payment pursuant to a guaranty by 
[Enron Re][of the obligations of Bob West Treasure, LLC to make payments 
pursuant to Section ___ of the [underlying Financing Agreement between Bob 
West Treasure and Royal Bank of Canada - this needs to be clarifed - is the 
payment related to the RBC loan or the insurance payment by EFR?  If it is 
the RBC loan then this clause is appropriate but if, alternatively, it is the 
EFR insurance payment, then the reference needs to be changed accordingly.]]  
The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is required to 
report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to the 
Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, such party shall 
report such item consistent with the characterization set forth above and 
shall not take any position on any tax return or report relating to United 
States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with such 
characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they have 
agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income tax 
purposes may be different from the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for non-United States federal income tax purposes and for 
accounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The provisions of this Section are 
not intended to affect the manner in which the parties report the Transaction 
for such other purposes, or the interpretation of the provisions of the 
Confirmation and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, 
for any purposes.

Sara,

I have a couple quick comments on the letter you sent this morning.  In
general, we need to make clear that we are replacing the credit support
provider under the ISDA.  Otherwise, I am concerned that we could face a
possible default under the ISDA once the VRI parental guaranty is
terminated. Otherwise, the letter looks very agreeable to me.  I am
anticipating we can get this executed today so please keep in touch with me
in regards to any further changes you would like to make.

Many thanks for all your help.

Best regards,

Nicole Russell

I am forwarding this to our Controls Group people who are working on a manual

I am asking them to complete your list and get back with you. I should know 
next week how long this will require.

Subject: 1.5 MW WTG SPC reports

Tom/Kevin,

In the development of the 1.5 MW WTG Statistical Process Control (SPC) 
reporting tool we have some additional questions regarding the data which 
comes to us from VisuPro.   In the attached spreadsheet you will find a 
listing of most of the channels which VisuPro uses to record data.  With some 
exceptions, each channel should correspond to a transducer on the turbine.  
The channel name and number can be found in the left columns as they are 
presented in VisuPro.  The ""Alias"" column is my attempt to better understand 
the channel and put a more meaningful label on the channel for presentation 
to the field personnel.  Wherever there is a blank it means that I do not 
have a good explanation of the channel and need more information.  

You can ignore the grey shading.  It is just an indicator as to whether the 
particular channel is currently included in the existing version of our SPC 
analytic.  The more interesting column is the ""Include"" column which is our 
future plan regarding inclusion of the particular channel in the next 
revision of the analytic.

Please do provide comments regarding simplified label names.  Also please 
note that I need further clarification on cells with comments inserted (look 
for the red traingle in the top right corner of 3 of the cells).

The other thing I would really like to have is a picture, or drawing, of the 
exact location of each of the transducers we are planning on including.  This 
would give myself and the field personnel great insight as to what the 
measurements really represent.

Thanks,
Hollis

Thanks.  I got Jim's and Eric's right after lunch.  Jim was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  Eric seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Jeff, 
Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products 
origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you 
like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2 
weeks, do we need him?  Maybe we do.

remember exactly when you were coming home, so called your office.  Holly
called us back to say that you were due back Wednesday.  That was a
relief because we knew you weren't in the air on Tuesday.  It just dawned
on me this morning that your e-mail was from you usual address so you
could probably receive mail in London at that address as well as send.

Tim called about 10:45 Tuesday morning to say that they weren't allowing
anyone to leave his base so he was stuck there for awhile but Sharon was
OK and going home.  Either his information was erroneous or the base was
opened not long thereafter because he was also allowed to leave and both
were home by early afternoon.  I was concerned about how long it would
take Sharon to drive home because 20 years ago when I was driving home
during a storm and all the government offices were closing, it was a zoo.
 It turned out that Sharon drove right along the river and up Rock Creek
Park with hardly any traffic since the streets between hers along the
river and the rest of the city were already closed so no streets were
emptying into hers.

Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California.  They brought his
flight down in Dallas and he was planning to drive home from Dallas.
Someone at my office told me yesterday that her brother was stuck in
Houston and was driving back to Cincinnati!

Nick's sixth grade class in Wyoming was told about the situation. I don't
know if they let them watch the TV.  Janet was oblivious--out doing
errands--so there was noone at home.  However, Ivan stopped by the house
for some reason just when Nick called home.  Nick was concerned about you
and Tim because he couldn't remember where you live.  That really touched
me, that he would think of you and that the school let him call home.  I
called them when Tim called to let us know they were all home safely and
that you were in London.

At the time this was happening we had no idea where would be struck next.
 You have probably heard that the FBI now says that the flight that went
into the Pentagon was originally going to hit the White House and that
the flight that went down over PA undoubtedly was bound for a more
populated target.    We were watching when the towers collapsed and found
it surreal--unbelievable.  We watched for some time after that but
finally we couldn't stand it.  We just had to turn off the TV and do
something else.  That seemed almost dishonorable though--to look outside
on a beautiful sunny, peaceful day here.  We were having a primary
election for mayor in the city so we went to vote because that was
something positive we could accomplish.  During the rest of the day we
checked the status of the situation regularly, but didn't watch for a
prolonged time.  It was impossible to concentrate on much of anything.

Now I feel that we need to return to normal activities as much as
possible to keep our little part of the country running as usual.  The
terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't.

I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world.  At least you
have an Enron office where you are.  I should think that would be better
than being stuck somewhere in Canada, wondering if you should drive home.
 I hope they are providing you some space where you can accomplish
something.  I imagine you are keeping the phone lines busy to Houston
these days.  I just read in the Wall Street Journal this morning that the
Y2K plans are paying off for some companies who had alternate plans for
communication difficulties and even ""bunkers"" or alternate offices in
place that they are now using.

This will surely be a test of our president and his government.  I hope
they are up to it.

Please let us know when you finally get home.

Love, Mother

Re: Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change - Action in Congress & the=20
Administration

Date:   April 30, 2001

In the current debate over how the U.S. should approach domestic and=20
international climate change issues, focus has increased lately on explorin=
g=20
=01&voluntary=018 approaches to reduce greenhouse gases.  President Bush=01=
,s=20
statements that the U.S. would not impose mandatory CO2 reductions on power=
=20
plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the U.S. shou=
ld=20
not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol (which contains actual=20
commitments on emission reductions) have driven the discussion about=20
voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result=
s.

Two articles (attached) appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend. =
=20
The first, reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle=
=20
(D-S.D.) where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new=20
approaches to address climate change, including voluntary compliance with=
=20
greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.  In response to strong criticism b=
y=20
environmentalists, a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from=
=20
those remarks and re-states his support for =01&binding measures=018 to red=
uce=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  =20

Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron=
=01,s=20
input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs.  =
=20
As the Administration=01,s Climate Change Task Force is preparing its=20
recommendations for a new U.S. proposal, our input is needed in the next fe=
w=20
weeks.
Experience with Voluntary Approaches - Back to the Future?
The U.S. and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly=
=20
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through=20
voluntary measures alone.  It is not yet known whether the Bush=20
Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower=
=20
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.  However, it is unlikely th=
at=20
a U.S. proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any=20
credibility in the international debate. =20
Clearly, industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong=20
program, but as recent weeks suggest, Administration officials have differi=
ng=20
views on objectives and approaches.    Below are some recent examples of wh=
y=20
voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results:
1) Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by former=20
President Bush and subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate, developed=20
countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 19=
90=20
levels by the year 2000.  By 1995, industrialized countries acknowledged th=
at=20
they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal, and initiated negotiatio=
ns=20
to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments.  These=
=20
negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocol=01,s targets and timetables, wh=
ere=20
industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo=
ut=20
5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 and the U.S. agreed to a=
=20
reduction of 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.=20

2) On the domestic level, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo=
p=20
a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc=
e=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  The aim of the =01&1605b=018 program is to encou=
rage=20
voluntary emissions reductions.  While some companies participate in the=20
program, it has not yielded significant emissions reductions.  Companies=20
participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain=
=20
experience with inventories, reporting and verification.  Many hope to be=
=20
rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator=
y=20
program.  To encourage participation, 1605b provides wide flexibility on=20
setting a baseline.  It also allows for dual reporting of emissions=20
reductions, self-certification of reductions and permits the entity to deci=
de=20
the level of reporting it undertakes.

A 1998 GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of=
=20
the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not=20
qualify as =01&real, appropriately reviewed and verified=018 emissions redu=
ctions. =20
Congress has been considering how to strengthen the 1605b program for sever=
al=20
years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla=
ns.

3) Chafee/Lieberman =01&Credit for Early Action=018 legislation:  In the 10=
6th=20
Congress, the debate centered around proposals to help U.S. businesses=20
achieve =01&credit=018 for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases.  T=

=20
regulatory regimes, difficulty with setting baselines for determining which=
=20
voluntary actions warrant credit, and political problems with links to=20

Opportunities for Enron

Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our=
=20
role as a respected source for information on how to structure market-based=
=20
systems for emissions reductions, Enron is well situated to provide=20
high-level input to the Administration and Congress toward developing=20
credible energy and climate change proposals.  In particular, we have a rea=
l=20
opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses - new generation=
,=20
gas, energy efficiency, emissions trading and risk management - while handi=
ng=20
the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues.

Enron=01,s input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in=
 real=20
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, while providing full flexibility fo=
r=20
companies and others to meet clear goals.  We have already indicated to the=
=20
Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures=20
could fit into a comprehensive package, but will likely fall short of=20
environmental and international expectations. =20

The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks, and the=
=20
White House=01,s Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c=
hange=20

There are a variety of CAs with U.S. Duke Energy entities.   

Mary J. Heinitz has provided me with a list of these which I'll forward to 
Mark for his consideration under the cover of a separate email.

Thanks, Edmund.

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing 
is a marketing sub and does not prepare separate financials.  The S&P rating 
is based on an implied guaranty from Duke Energy.  Legal would also need to 
review this counterparty from the standpoint of confidentiality agreement 
violations. 

Also, as a trading counterparty, Sempra Energy Trading is not authorized for 
credit derivative trading, because the existing guaranty does not explicitly 
cover this type of transaction.  If Sempra wishes to transact out of this 
entity, we can look into amending the guaranty to cover this product.  This 
will require legal efforts and approval.

To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:

1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty
2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential 
information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential 
information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since 
it is written more in our favor.
3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided.
4.  The address of the counterparty
5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty

Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.

LAWYER--CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL

People:

I have recently seen a new Navajo Nation document concerning a ROW which
reflects a ""standard term and condition"" I had not seen before. Since I am not
sure whether you all have seen it, I am providing it in this e-mail:

""There is expressly reserved to the Navajo Nation full territorial
legislative, executive and judicial jurisdiction over the right-of-way and all
lands burdened by the right-of-way, including without limitation over all
persons, including the public, and all activities conducted or otherwise
occurring within the right-of-way; and the right-of-way and all lands burdened
by the right-of-way shall be and forever remain Navajo Indian Country for
purposes of Navajo Nation jurisdiction.""

As you appreciate, this appears to be Steve Bloxham, Esq. (Navajo Nation
Department of Justice)'s latest response to federal court decisions on Indian
jurisdiction.

Perhaps it would save time for Steve if we simply had a provision in the ROW
which said, ""In the event of any conflict between opinions of federal courts
and of Steve Bloxham, Esq., the opinion of Steve Bloxham, Esq. shall govern
this ROW. All ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of the Bloxham
interpretation.""

I've got Ken Lay tentatively scheduled to speak to Town Hall Los Angeles on 
Tuesday, Aug. 7.  They were thrilled to hear that Ken had an interest in 
speaking to the group, and Jim McNulty with Parsons immediately recognized 
Ken and wants him to speak about the ""big energy picture,"" given Enron's 
global perspective.  They've got a pretty heavy energy calendar in the next 
few months:
 May 16 - Phil Angelides
 June 19 - John Bryson
 July 11 - Steve Ledbetter
 July 26 - Loretta Lynch

You may want to attend these luncheons just to see what  these four have to 
say.  I've asked if Warren Olney could do the interview w/ Ken, and Adrian 
Medawar said she'd call him.

Sandra -- would you check with LABA to see if we could do that meeting the 
same trip (either before or after Town Hall).

Great job lining this one up -- thank you!

See you in San Fran.

""If municipal bond investors didn't buy bonds every time some adviser turned out to be a crook, there wouldn't be a municipal bond market."" 

Energy crisis back on front burner 
Staffers' stocks rekindle political heat and may jeopardize power contracts. 
August 5, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
and JAMES B. KELLEHER
The Orange County Register 
Just when California seemed to be crawling out from under the wreckage of its year-old energy crisis, the state finds itself embroiled in a new crisis. 
In the past week, more than half a dozen advisers to Gov. Gray Davis, including some hired at taxpayer expense specifically to buy power from generating companies, admitted that they owned shares of generating companies or utilities. Five were fired, and one resigned. 
One of the state's top negotiators of long-term power-purchase contracts, consultant Vikram Budhraja, is the subject of an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He disclosed he profited from trading shares of Edison International, parent of Southern California Edison, during days when the state was negotiating energy contracts and buying electricity to keep the firm from bankruptcy. 
These conflict-of-interest revelations represent more than an embarrassment for the governor. 
They also threaten to prolong a crisis that has already cost weary Californians as much as $100 billion by some estimates - easily the most expensive public-policy disaster in state history. 
If the contracts are found to have been compromised by state negotiators who had conflicts of interest, they could be nullified. If that happens, the state could find itself back where it was in January: scrambling to find reliable, inexpensive sources of power to stave off blackouts and avoid breaking the state budget. 
Some in Sacramento would like nothing better than to undo the contracts, which they say cost the state too much at $43 billion over 20 years. 
""The Legislature is dying to find a way out of those contracts,"" said Peter Navarro, a professor of economics at University of California, Irvine. 
""If there is any possibility that the conflict of interest can nullify some or all of those, then you will see some forward movement on this,"" Navarro said. 
Of course, if the state does renegotiate the contracts, it could wind up getting better prices. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the author of California's electricity-purchasing law (AB1X), said there has been sentiment in the Legislature to renegotiate some contracts if possible. 
""I guess it would be too much to hope for to have the luck to have the ability to renegotiate or unwind some of the contracts,"" he said, adding that it was clear that under some contracts, the prices were high. 
However, ""there are a lot of people like me who think the governor did exactly the right thing in these contracts by buying long, which is what we instructed him to do in AB1X,"" he said. 
The revelations come at an awkward time for the state. Last week, while the disclosures mounted, state Treasurer Phil Angelides was on Wall Street, trying to drum up interest in the $12.5 billion bond sale intended to repay the state for the $9.6 billion it has spent purchasing power for consumers so far this year. 
But so far, the disclosures don't seem to have raised more than an eyebrow or two on Wall Street. 
""What we're interested in is, are we going to get paid back?"" said Mary Beth Syal, a municipal bond portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles investment firm with expertise in fixed income. ""As a bondholder you really don't care about (conflicts of interest) except if there's fraud. Then it becomes an issue. Anything else and it really doesn't have an impact."" 
Or as Zane Mann, the editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, put it: ""If municipal bond investors didn't buy bonds every time some adviser turned out to be a crook, there wouldn't be a municipal bond market."" 
The current crisis over conflicts of interest has its roots in January. With power prices skyrocketing, Southern California Edison defaulting on bond payments and energy producers threatening to push the state's utilities into bankruptcy and stop selling electricity into California, Davis declared an emergency - putting the state in the electricity-buying business. 
Davis tried to bring some expertise on board, hurriedly hiring consultants, buyers, schedulers and others, in what his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, concedes was a chaotic and desperate push. 
Many qualified people had already been hired by power-trading companies, leaving a small pool of candidates for the specialized tasks, said Maviglio. 
""DWR was in an emergency situation, and we hired the best people we could that were available,"" he said. ""The number of people in the energy-buying business in California is limited. This is not a job where you just put an ad in the classifieds. There were not a lot of experienced traders in the field."" 
In the rush to bring staff on board and keep the lights on in the state, however, Davis and his team neglected to get many of the new hires to fill out personal financial disclosures required by California's Political Reform Act. Under that law, state employees have 30 days to disclose their financial interests and must update them yearly. 
Then, last month, under prodding from Secretary of State Bill Jones, who blasted Davis' failure to ensure his energy advisers complied with the act, disclosures started pouring in - and revelations started pouring out. 
Jones, a Republican candidate for governor next year, says at least some of the contracts may be at risk. State Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing the financial-disclosure statements of the DWR's energy consultants for conflicts of interest and potential prosecutions, said Lockyer spokesman Nathan Barankin. 
State law bars government employees from negotiating contracts with companies in which they have a financial interest. It also says those contracts may be invalidated if conflicts existed, but only if at least one of the parties to a contract requests it. Then a court must rule whether there was a conflict and if it was of a magnitude to warrant nullifying the contract. 
But the Davis administration's review of the contracts shows that none is imperiled, Maviglio said. 
""Our understanding is that they are solid - all of them,"" he said. ""Everything is being reviewed, but at first glance they appear to be solid."" 
Others question whether Davis can review the contracts impartially, since he hired the advisers who negotiated them, and he trumpeted them as a key solution that helped bring down power prices and kept the state blackout-free this summer. 
""Davis can't question the propriety of the contracts without questioning his own propriety,"" Navarro said. ""Maviglio has to circle the wagons."" 
Maviglio disclosed last week that he bought $12,000 worth of shares of San Jose-based generator Calpine Corp. in June. He sold it last week at a loss of about $1,200. 
As the debate goes on in Sacramento, investors on Wall Street seem keen only to learn more about the bond deal's structure and timing. The bond sale has been delayed from May until at least October, and could be delayed further because of opposition by the state's utilities to the way consumer rates would repay the bonds. 
Angelides, who believes the sale will take place by late October, bragged last week that most of the uncertainties that forced the state to postpone the bond deal had cleared up, thanks to conservation, the state's actions and some luck. 
""As a factual matter,"" Angelides said, ""costs and prices are down, volatility is reduced through a combination of efforts - everything from contracts to federal controls to return to production to conservation efforts. 
""The importance of this for the financing program, and I want to stress this, is that the level of volatility in the marketplace and with respect to DWR costs has been dramatically reduced, which is important in terms of folks looking at the stability and certainty of the revenue flow going forward."" 
But if contracts are nullified, some of that volatility could return. DWR would be forced to make more purchases on the unpredictable spot market. That could throw another wrench into the state's plans to recover its power-buying expenditures and return normalcy to the market. 
""Every time there is another layer of stench put on top of one of these contracts, there is more risk perceived in Wall Street, and more burden placed on taxpayers and ratepayers,"" Navarro said. 
State staffers and advisers posing conflict-of-interest questions 
A rundown of known conflicts of interest, actual and potential: 
Five consultants at the Department of Water Resources - William F. Mead, Richard Ferreira, Peggy Cheng, Herman Leung and Constantine Louie - were fired after their disclosure statements, filed under pressure six months late, showed they negotiated state power purchases with companies whose stock they owned. 
A sixth consultant who also had purchased stock, Elaine Griffin, resigned July 14 to take another job. 
The DWR's top attorney, Susan Weber, who had a role in advising the consultants, was reassigned to another state job unrelated to energy. She had no financial conflict. 
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, bought 300 shares of Calpine Corp. in June at $40 a share. Under pressure, he sold it Thursday at $36 a share. Calpine, a San Jose-based power generator, received about $13 billion in electricity contracts with the state for the next 20 years. 
Two political consultants, Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, whose firm has done work for Southern California Edison, were hired by Davis and placed on the state payroll at $30,000 a month. Both left under pressure, including a lawsuit by a taxpayers group and complaints that the governor used state funds to finance political work. 
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, the author of energy-related legislation - including the creation of the state's Public Power Authority - has investments in El Paso Energy Co., which he acquired last July, and Exxon Mobil Corp., Haliburton Co. and Meeker Investments. He also bought and sold between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of Williams Co. stock last fall. 
The governor's top Wall Street adviser for energy is Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners LLC. Fichera and his company have a $275,000-a-month state contract that provides a bonus of up to $14.6 million if the state purchases Southern California Edison's grid. Fichera has not provided a financial-disclosure statement, saying the government's rules do not require it. He has said he has no energy holdings that conflict with California's power-purchasing program. 
Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting Inc., hired in January by DWR, bought between $10,000 and $100,000 of General Electric Co. and Enron Corp. stock in April. 
Vikram Budhraja, a former Edison executive, has a $6.2 million contract to negotiate long-term energy contracts for the state. He bought and sold Edison and Dynegy stock during January, when he was hired. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing his transactions, his lawyer said. 
William Keese, the chairman of the California Energy Commission, which licenses power plants, has purchased and sold energy stocks during his tenure on the commission. The stocks were in managed portfolios, not subject to his control. Keese has asked the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate. 
Bruce G. Willison, a member of the state's Electricity Oversight Board, owns about $600,000 in Enron stock. 
Disclosing conflicts can be a convoluted process 
Public officials at every level of state and local government must reveal personal financial information. 
Elected officials, judges and high-ranking appointed officials must make the most comprehensive disclosures. 
This includes interests in real property, investments, sources of personal income and outside employment, including directorships and consulting contracts. The reports are filed annually at the headquarters of the state's Fair Political Practices Commission. 
For other officials, such as the employees of state and local governments, it is up to each agency to set disclosure requirements, following the policy set by the FPPC. These reports are filed with the individual agency. 
Not every person on the public payroll, however, is required to disclose personal financial information. At the Department of Water Resources, for example, consultants who were hired to perform duties that are ""limited in scope"" are exempt. 
A conflict of interest occurs when a public official uses his or her position to make decisions that result in personal financial gain. 
Assets and income that could be affected by an official's actions must be disclosed and, in many cases, divested. 
Officials cannot negotiate contracts with companies in which they have a financial interest. If this happens, the contracts could be subject to nullifcation. 
The state attorney general or local prosecutors determine whether a conflict has occurred, and whether a criminal prosecution is necessary. The FPPC can investigate, but not prosecute, and can impose civil fines of up to $2,000 per violation.

THIS NOTE IS FROM TED MURPHY (not bjorn hagelman)

My understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the 
intent
of diverting resources from the GRMS project to some other project.

While I am not privy to the urgency of this other project, I do know that we
have a very large, multi -phase project going in GRMS.
GRMS stands for the GLOBAL RISK MONITORING SYSTEM.  It is not intended to be a
commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial
decision-making.  Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary purpose
of RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems and their
inability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.

RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task
list to accomplish its objectives.  As a firm we are woefully behind our press
clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.  My 
most
recent sojorn  in Europe is a classic example of the current systems inabilty 
to
aggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision making and
causing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that of the Market
Risk Group in RAC.

The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to do
our jobs.  We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter to
make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with Jonathon 
and
his team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.  While progress is never as
fast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have only to rely on
RAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been hit.  The
primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of resources 
off
the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source - most
recently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to deadlines.

Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note,
but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.
Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration 
on
the lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting itself in
the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.

I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase
project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.  Please let us 
do
our jobs.  I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that they
must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our consideration of
their worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own project with their own
resources.

Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.  As it relates to things 
that
will effect the ability of Market Risk to do its job, please consult me as I
would you.

Ted

Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note 
to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but 
it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day 
business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES 
(my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to 
find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support 
costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in 
June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.    
All of these of course with top priority!  

I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.  She has already made  a 
very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations 
side.  

How is life treating you?  I know that their is a lot going on in the London 
office, as well.  How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office 
been?  Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?  

Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding 
their baby.  

Hope that all is well with you.  --Sally "

Would you PLEASE go into the CAS system and let me know what shippers have primary firm at these three points:

NWPL La Plata   POI #500533
WFS Ignacio      POI #500535
Amoco Florida    POI #500536

I will then look at each individual contract and determine where they are delivering the gas to determine our commodity

We need to be able to demonstrate some measurable benefit to Enron in doing this.  Since we are not making any post-bankruptcy settlement payments, pushing the payment date back is not enough.  What other benefit would there be?  Why again does the customer want to do this?

Carol, in regards to our discussion yesterday evening.  I have a customer who wants to roll some of his hedges back a few months.  We are ""out of the money"" on the hedges.  The roll will be done where it does not change our liability.  This is better for ENE because it pushes our liabilities due out into the future by about six months.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks for your help.

Another Division

Mark,

Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a 
division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these 
counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of 
the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as 
divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do 
you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as 
divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss 
divisions?  What to do?

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Samuel

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like ""Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc.""  
or ""Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division"".

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.

As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital 
and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the 
NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are 
positive value to the book.

A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).  
The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are 
awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Linda LIndsay"

CONFIDENTIAL

Because many of the same people would be involved in the below-referenced telecons, both of which relate to developing public and gov relations strategies, some in the context of legal issues, I have scheduled a one hour conference call, half hour each for Roseville and the DC Line to SF.  I have indicated who at least I would like involved in each conversation.  The rest of you can feel free to listen on the whole thing, or drop off or call in as appropriate.  If I have left anyone out of the list, please call me to discuss, as I would like to restrict these discussions to the recipients of the email.  (Mark - if you wish Eric or Karen to participate, no problem.) 

The call in number for both calls will be 800-820-4690 (passcode: 7012645#)

1:00 - 1:30pm:  ROSEVILLE

""Required"" participants
	Wehn
	Brodbeck
	Jones
	Russeth
	Govenar(s)

ISSUE - Butte county APCD is resisting the transfer of certain ERCs that we own from Butte county to Placer county for our Roseville project. I want to discuss who knows who and which of them we can call to enlist support for our position.  For example, Kelly has already petitioned CARB, who have said that this is not right and will pressure them.  I will get a letter from the ISO indicating the general economic support our Roseville project will have to the area, including Butte.  Dean Russell and Rick Johnson are going to get the support of the Building Trades because of the obvious risk on jobs.  I would guess that all of Kelly's new-found farmer friends (sorry, they are called growers out here) can make a few phone calls.  I am sure that Scott and Heady can find some political friends in Sacto that we can call.  Etc.

Please come to the telecon with a list of who you have already contacted, and who we may consider contacting.  In the interest of time, I want to set the stage for giving Kelly and Sam some clear guidelines and assignments.  Then we can let them do their work and report.  And we can get on to the next subject.


1:30 - 2:00 pm:  DC LINE TO SF

""Required"" Participants
	Palmer
	Russeth
	Govenar(s)
	Etringer
	Gray
	Dasovich
	Rasmussen	

ISSUE - As we have discussed, we are developing a strategy that, if successful, would result in a transmission line solution to SF's electrical problems.	  I would like this telecon to be a kick off to discussing/developing a PR and Government relations strategy.  Each of you have reviewed my summary email of last week (I have attached a copy for Dasovich and Palmer), so I will not repeat here.  It is for the most part self explanatory on issues, status, benefits, etc.  Please bring to the telecon your thoughts.

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Subject: September Wholesale Volumes


It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
The database for September is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, 
this is the shortcut on your desktop called ""Statistical Database"". 

As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor 
Relations requests that Business Analysis & Reporting provide monthly 
volumetric analysis for Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly 
analysis.  Please review the analysis for September 2000 and provide 
explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, 
quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.  The current objective of 
Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential 
investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and 
presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial 
personnel.

Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 3:00pm 
Tuesday, October 10th.  Please feel free to call with any questions.

Hi,

Several students have expressed interest in my holding additional
sessions on finding periodical articles using ABI/Inform and Dow Jones
interactive.

If you haven't attended one of these sessions and would like to do so,
please let me know which days/weeks are best for you. I'll then set up
something based on your response.

Thanks.

this.

You may want to consider whether certain issues or solutions discussed here
would be applicable to Enron.

We will review this in the morning.  In the meantime, it would be extremely
helpful to know what the practical effect of your calculation would be.  In
other words, using this method, what is the valuation of each of the
packages as of today?  Please e-mail your calculation to each of us on the
PG&E team.  Thanks, Peter
