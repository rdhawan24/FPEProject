I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges.

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges.

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges.

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges.

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges.

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges.

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n

I also spoke with Jeff about how \nEnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) \nis responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of \nJeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  \nMaybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.  \nSara\n\n\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t08/29/2000 07:24 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rod \nNelson/LON/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Credit Derivatives\n\nSara,\n\nPlease contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  \nRod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be \navailable in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but \nI am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other \nthings Credit support for his business.  \n\nIt does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without \nTreasury's approval.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Sara Shackleton on 08/28/2000 06:53 PM\nTo: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Credit Derivatives\n\nI am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in \nHouston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in \nthe name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are \nbacked to EnronCredit.com Limited.  \n\nIn particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ \nInternational Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have \nno master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit \nderivatives?\n\nFYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.\n\n\n\n

Please keep in mind that the\nsystems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements\nprocess so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not\napplied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should\nnot be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become\neffective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the\nSettlement process. \n\nI checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during\nSeptember. \nTake care. \nKeoni Almeida \nCalifornia Independent System Operator \nphone: 916/608-7053\npager:  916/814-7352 \nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\n  \n
